<h2><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The author would scarcely have penned this little specimen of 
what Scott called &ldquo;antiquarian old womanries,&rdquo; but 
for the interest which he takes in the universally diffused 
archaic patterns on rocks and stones, which offer a singular 
proof of the identity of the working of the human mind.&nbsp; 
Anthropology and folklore are the natural companions and aids of 
prehistoric and proto-historic archaeology, and suggest remarks 
which may not be valueless, whatever view we may take of the 
disputed objects from the Clyde sites.</p>
<p>While only an open verdict on these objects is at present 
within the competence of science, the author, speaking for 
himself, must record his private opinion that, as a rule, they 
are ancient though anomalous.&nbsp; He cannot pretend to 
certainty as to whether the upper parts of the marine structures 
were throughout built of stone, as in Dr. Munro&rsquo;s theory, 
which is used as the fundamental assumption in this book; or <!--
page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
vi</span>whether they were of wood, as in the hypothesis of Mr. 
Donnelly, illustrated by him in the Glasgow <i>Evening Times</i> 
(Sept. 11, 1905).&nbsp; The point seems unessential.&nbsp; The 
author learns from Mr. Donnelly that experiments in shaping piles
with an ancient stone axe have been made by Mr. Joseph Downes, of
Irvine, as by Monsieur Hippolyte M&uuml;ller in France, with 
similar results, a fact which should have been mentioned in the 
book.&nbsp; It appears too, that a fragment of fallow deer horn 
at Dumbuck, mentioned by Dr. Munro, turned out to be &ldquo;a 
decayed <i>humerus</i> of the <i>Bos Longifrons</i>,&rdquo; and 
therefore no evidence as to date, as post-Roman.</p>
<p>Mr. Donnelly also protests that his records of his excavations
&ldquo;were exceptionally complete,&rdquo; and that he 
&ldquo;took daily notes and sketches of all features and finds 
with measurements.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must mention these facts, as, 
in the book, I say that Mr. Donnelly &ldquo;kept no minute and 
hourly dated log book of his explorations, with full details as 
to the precise positions of the objects discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If in any respect I have misconceived the facts and arguments,
I trust that the fault will be ascribed to nothing worse than 
human fallibility.</p>
<p>I have to thank Mr. Donnelly for permission <!-- page vii--><a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>to 
photograph some objects from Dumbuck and for much 
information.</p>
<p>To Dr. Munro, apart from his most valuable books of crannog 
lore, I owe his kind attention to my private inquiries, and hope 
that I successfully represent his position and arguments.&nbsp; 
It is quite undeniable that the disputed objects are most 
anomalous as far as our present knowledge goes, and I do not 
think that science can give more than all I plead for, an open 
verdict.&nbsp; Dr. Ricardo Severe generously permitted me to 
reproduce a few (by no means the most singular) of his designs 
and photographs of the disputed Portuguese objects.&nbsp; A 
serious illness has prevented him from making a visit recently to
the scene of the discoveries (see his paper in <i>Portugalia</i>,
vol. ii., part 1).&nbsp; I trust that Dr. de Vasconcellos, from 
whom I have not yet heard, will pardon the reproduction of three 
or four figures from his <i>Religi&otilde;es</i>, an important 
work on prehistoric Portugal.</p>
<p>To Dr. Joseph Anderson, of the National Museum, I owe much 
gratitude for information, and for his great kindness in 
superintending the photographing of some objects now in that 
Museum.</p>
<p>Dr. David Murray obliged me by much information as to the 
early navigation of the Clyde, <!-- page viii--><a 
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>and the 
alterations made in the bed of the river.&nbsp; To Mr. David 
Boyle, Ontario, I owe the knowledge of Red Indian magic stones 
parallel to the perforated and inscribed stone from Tappock.</p>
<p>As I have quoted from Dr. Munro the humorous tale of the 
palaeolithic designs which deceived M. Lartet and Mr. Christie, I
ought to observe that, in <i>L&rsquo;Anthropologie</i>, August, 
1905, a reviewer of Dr. Munro&rsquo;s book, Prof. Boule, 
expresses some doubt as to the authenticity of the 
<i>historiette</i>.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
1</span>I&mdash;THE CLYDE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The reader who desires to be hopelessly perplexed, may desert 
the contemplation of the Fiscal Question, and turn his eyes upon 
<i>The Mystery of the Clyde</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Popular&rdquo; this
puzzle cannot be, for there is no &ldquo;demmed demp disagreeable
body&rdquo; in the Mystery.&nbsp; No such object was found in 
Clyde, near Dumbarton, but a set of odd and inexpensive looking, 
yet profoundly enigmatic scraps of stone, bone, slate, horn and 
so forth, were discovered and now repose in a glass case at the 
National Museum in Queen Street, Edinburgh.</p>
<p>There, as in the Morgue, lies awaiting explanation the 
<i>corpus delicti</i> of the Clyde Mystery.&nbsp; We stare at it 
and ask what are these slate spear heads engraved with rude 
ornament, and certainly never meant to be used as &ldquo;lethal 
weapons&rdquo;?&nbsp; What are these many-shaped perforated 
plaques of slate, shale, and schist, scratched with some of the 
old <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>mysterious patterns that, in almost every part of the 
world, remain inscribed on slabs and faces of rock?&nbsp; Who 
incised similar patterns on the oyster-shells, some old and 
local, some fresh&mdash;<i>and American</i>!&nbsp; Why did any 
one scratch them?&nbsp; What is the meaning, if meaning there be,
of the broken figurines or stone &ldquo;dolls&rdquo;?&nbsp; They 
have been styled &ldquo;totems&rdquo; by persons who do not know 
the meaning of the word &ldquo;totem,&rdquo; which merely denotes
the <i>natural</i> object,&mdash;usually a plant or 
animal,&mdash;after which sets of kinsfolk are named among 
certain savage tribes.&nbsp; Let us call the little figures 
&ldquo;figurines,&rdquo; for that commits us to nothing.</p>
<p>Then there are grotesque human heads, carved in stone; bits of
sandstone, marked with patterns, and so forth.&nbsp; Mixed with 
these are the common rude appliances, quern stones for grinding 
grain; stone hammers, stone polishers, cut antlers of deer, 
pointed bones, such as rude peoples did actually use, in early 
Britain, and may have retained into the early middle ages, say 
400-700 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>
<p>This mixed set of objects, <i>plus</i> the sites in which they
were found, and a huge canoe, 35 feet long, is the material part 
of the Clyde Mystery.&nbsp; The querns and canoe and 
stone-polishers, and bones, and horns are commonly found, we say,
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
3</span>in dwellings of about 400-700 <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; The peculiar and enigmatic things
are <i>not</i> elsewhere known to Scottish antiquaries.&nbsp; How
did the two sets of objects come to be all mixed up together, in 
an old hill fort, at Dunbuie on Clyde; and among the wooden 
foundations of two mysterious structures, excavated in the mud of
the Clyde estuary at Dumbuck and Langbank, near Dumbarton?&nbsp; 
They were dug up between 1896 and 1902.</p>
<p>This is the question which has been debated, mainly in 
newspaper controversy, for nearly ten years.&nbsp; A most 
rambling controversy it has been, casting its feelers as far as 
central Australia, in space, and as far back as, say, 1200 <span 
class="smcap">b.c.</span> in time.</p>
<p>Either the disputed objects at the Museum are actual relics of
life lived in the Clyde basin many centuries ago; or the 
discoverers and excavators of the old sites are dogged by a 
forger who &ldquo;dumps down&rdquo; false relics of kinds unknown
to Scottish antiquaries; or some of the unfamiliar objects are 
really old, while others are jocose imitations of these, 
or&mdash;there is some other explanation!</p>
<p>The modern &ldquo;Clyde artists&rdquo; are credited by Dr. 
Robert Munro with &ldquo;some practical artistic skill,&rdquo; 
and some acquaintance with the very old and mysterious designs on
great rocks among <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the neighbouring hills. <a 
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4" 
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; What man of artistic skill, no 
conscience, and a knowledge of archaic patterns is associated 
with the Clyde?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;faker&rdquo; is not the mere mischievous wag of the
farm-house or the country shop.&nbsp; It is possible that a few 
&ldquo;interpolations&rdquo; of false objects have been made by 
another and less expert hand, but the weight of the problem rests
on these alternatives,&mdash;the disputed relics which were found
are mainly genuine, though unfamiliar; or a forger not destitute 
of skill and knowledge has invented and executed 
them&mdash;or&mdash;there is some other explanation.</p>
<p>Three paths, as usual, are open to science, in the present 
state of our knowledge of the question.&nbsp; We may pronounce 
the unfamiliar relics genuine, and prove it if we can.&nbsp; We 
may declare them to be false objects, manufactured within the 
last ten years.&nbsp; We may possess our souls in patience, and 
&ldquo;put the objects to a suspense account,&rdquo; awaiting the
results of future researches and of new information.</p>
<p>This attitude of suspense is not without precedent in 
archaeology.&nbsp; &ldquo;Antiquarian lore,&rdquo; as Dr. Munro 
remarks by implication, <i>can</i> &ldquo;distinguish <!-- page 
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>between 
true and false antiquities.&rdquo; <a name="citation5a"></a><a 
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a>&nbsp; But time is 
needed for the verdict, as we see when Dr. Munro describes 
&ldquo;the Breonio Controversy&rdquo; about disputed stone 
objects, a controversy which began in 1885, and appears to be 
undecided in 1905. <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a>&nbsp; I propose to advocate the third 
course; the waiting game, and I am to analyse Dr. Munro&rsquo;s 
very able arguments for adopting the second course, and deciding 
that the unfamiliar relics are assuredly impostures of 
yesterday&rsquo;s manufacture.</p>
<h2><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
6</span>II&mdash;DR. MUNRO&rsquo;S BOOK ON THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro&rsquo;s acute and interesting book, <i>Archaeology 
and False Antiquities</i>, <a name="citation6"></a><a 
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a> does not cover the 
whole of its amusing subject.&nbsp; False gems, coins, 
inscriptions, statues, and pictures are scarcely touched upon; 
the author is concerned chiefly with false objects of the 
pre-historic and &ldquo;proto-historic&rdquo; periods, and with 
these as bearing on the Clyde controversy of 1896-1905.&nbsp; Out
of 292 pages, at least 130 treat directly of that local dispute: 
others bear on it indirectly.</p>
<p>I have taken great interest in this subject since I first 
heard of it by accident, in the October or November of 
1898.&nbsp; As against Dr. Munro, from whose opinions I 
provisionally dissent, I may be said to have no <i>locus 
standi</i>.&nbsp; He is an eminent and experienced archaeologist 
in matters of European pre-historic and proto-historic 
times.&nbsp; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Any one is at liberty to say of me 
what another celebrated archaeologist, Mr. Charles Hercules Read,
said, in a letter to Dr. Munro, on December 7, 1901, about some 
one else: a person designated as &ldquo;---,&rdquo; and described
as &ldquo;a merely literary man, who cannot understand that to 
practised people the antiquities are as readable as print, and a 
good deal more accurate.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a 
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; But though 
&ldquo;merely literary,&rdquo; like Mr. &ldquo;---,&rdquo; I have
spent much time in the study of comparative anthropology; of the 
manners, ideas, customs, implements, and sacred objects of 
uncivilised and peasant peoples.&nbsp; Mr. &ldquo;---&rdquo; may 
not have done so, whoever he is.&nbsp; Again, as &ldquo;practised
people&rdquo; often vary widely in their estimates of antique 
objects, or objects professing to be antique, I cannot agree with
Mr. Read that &ldquo;the antiquities&rdquo; are &ldquo;as 
readable as print,&rdquo;&mdash;if by &ldquo;antiquities&rdquo; 
he means antiquities in general.&nbsp; At the British Museum I 
can show Mr. Read several admirable specimens of the art of 
faking, standing, like the Abomination of Desolation, where they 
ought not.&nbsp; It was not by unpractised persons that they were
purchased at the national expense.&nbsp; We are all fallible, 
even the oldest of us.&nbsp; I conceive Mr. Read, however, to 
mean the alleged and <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>disputed &ldquo;antiquities&rdquo; of 
the Clyde sites, and in that case, his opinion that they are a 
&ldquo;curious swindle&rdquo; is of the most momentous 
weight.</p>
<p>But, as to practised opinion on antiquities in general, Dr. 
Munro and I agree that it is really very fallible, now and 
again.&nbsp; The best authorities, he proves, may read 
antiquities differently.&nbsp; He is not certain that he has not 
himself, on occasion, taken &ldquo;fakes&rdquo; for true 
antiques. <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a" 
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; The <i>savants</i> of the Louvre 
were lately caught by the notorious &ldquo;tiara of 
Saitaphernes,&rdquo; to the pecuniary loss of France; were caught
on April 1, 1896, and were made <i>poissons d&rsquo;Avril</i>, to
the golden tune of 200,000 francs (&pound;8000).</p>
<p>Again, M. Lartet and Mr. Christy betted a friend that he could
not hoax them with a forged palaeolithic drawing.&nbsp; They lost
their bet, and, after M. Lartet&rsquo;s death, the forged object 
was published, as genuine, in the scientific journal, 
<i>Mat&eacute;riaux</i> (1874). <a name="citation8b"></a><a 
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; As M. Reinach 
says of another affair, it was &ldquo;a <i>fumisterie</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c" 
class="citation">[8c]</a>&nbsp; Every archaeologist may be the 
victim of a <i>fumisterie</i>, few have wholly escaped, and we 
find Dr. Furtwangler and Mr. Cecil Smith at odds as to whether a 
head <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>of Zeus in terra-cotta be of the fifth century <span 
class="smcap">b.c.</span> or, quite the contrary, of the 
nineteenth or twentieth century <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>
<p>Verily all &ldquo;practised people&rdquo; do not find 
&ldquo;antiquities as readable as print.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 
other hand, my late friend, Dr. A. S. Murray, Keeper of Classical
Antiquities in the British Museum, &ldquo;read&rdquo; the 
Mycenaean antiquities erroneously, placing them many centuries 
too late.&nbsp; M. de Mortillet reckoned them forgeries, and 
wrote of the discoverer, Dr. Schliemann, and even of Mrs. 
Schliemann, in a tone unusual in men of science and 
gentlemen.</p>
<p>The great palaeolithic discoveries of M. Boucher de Perthes, 
the very bases of our study of the most ancient men, were 
&ldquo;read&rdquo; as impostures by many &ldquo;practised 
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Cartailhac, again, has lately, in the 
most candid and honourable way, recanted his own original 
disbelief in certain wall-paintings in Spanish caves, of the 
period called &ldquo;palaeolithic,&rdquo; for long suspected by 
him of being &ldquo;clerical&rdquo; impostures. <a 
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9" 
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>Thus even the most &ldquo;practised people,&rdquo; like 
General Councils, &ldquo;may err and have erred,&rdquo; when 
confronted either with forgeries, or with objects old in fact, 
but new to them.&nbsp; They have <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>not</i> 
always found antiquities &ldquo;as readable as 
print.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Munro touches but faintly on these 
&ldquo;follies of the wise,&rdquo; but they are not unusual 
follies.&nbsp; This must never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Where &ldquo;practised people&rdquo; may be mistaken through a
too confirmed scepticism, the &ldquo;merely literary man&rdquo; 
may, once in an azure moon, happen to be right, or not 
demonstrably wrong; that is my excuse for differing, 
provisionally, from &ldquo;practised people.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is 
only provisionally that I dissent from Dr. Munro as to some of 
the points at issue in the Clyde controversy.&nbsp; I entered on 
it with very insufficient knowledge: I remain, we all remain, 
imperfectly informed: and like people rich in practice,&mdash;Dr.
Joseph Anderson, and Sir Arthur Mitchell,&mdash;I &ldquo;suspend 
my judgement&rdquo; for the present. <a name="citation10"></a><a 
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>This appears to me the most scientific attitude.&nbsp; Time is
the great revealer.&nbsp; But Dr. Munro, as we saw, prefers not 
to suspend his judgment, and says plainly and pluckily that the 
disputed objects in the Clyde controversy are 
&ldquo;spurious&rdquo;; are what the world calls 
&ldquo;fakes,&rdquo; though from a delicate sense of the 
proprieties of language, he will not call them 
&ldquo;forgeries.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are reckoned by him among 
&ldquo;false antiquities,&rdquo; while, for my <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>part, I know 
not of what age they are, but incline I believe that many of them
are not of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; This is the extent of 
our difference.&nbsp; On the other hand I heartily concur with 
Dr. Munro in regretting that his advice,&mdash;to subject the 
disputed objects at the earliest possible stage of the 
proceedings, to a jury of experts,&mdash;was not accepted. <a 
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a" 
class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>One observation must be made on Dr. Munro&rsquo;s logical 
method, as announced by himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;My role, on the 
present occasion, is to advocate the correctness of my own views 
on purely archaeological grounds, without any special effort to 
refute those of my opponents.&rdquo; <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; As my view 
is that the methods of Dr. Munro are perhaps,&mdash;and I say it 
with due deference, and with doubt,&mdash;capable of 
modification, I shall defend my opinions as best I may.&nbsp; 
Moreover, my views, in the course of seven long years (1898-1905)
have necessarily undergone some change, partly in deference to 
the arguments of Dr. Munro, partly because much new information 
has come to my knowledge since 1898-99.&nbsp; Moreover, on one 
occasion, I misstated my own view, and, though I later made my 
real opinion perfectly dear, some confusion was generated.</p>
<h2><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>III&mdash;THE CLYDE CONTROVERSY</h2>
<p>It is necessary, after these prefatory remarks, to give an 
account of the rise of the Clyde controversy, and I may be 
pardoned for following the example of Dr. Munro, who adds, and 
cannot but add, a pretty copious narrative of his own share in 
the discussion.&nbsp; In 1896, the hill fort of Dunbuie, 
&ldquo;about a mile-and-a-half to the east of Dumbarton Castle, 
and three miles to the west of the Roman Wall,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" 
class="citation">[12]</a> was discovered by Mr. W. A. Donnelly: 
that is to say, Mr. Donnelly suggested that the turf might 
conceal something worth excavating, and the work was undertaken, 
under his auspices, by the Helensburgh Antiquarian Society.</p>
<p>As Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s name constantly occurs in the 
discussion, it may be as well to state that, by profession, he is
an artist,&mdash;a painter and designer in black and 
white,&mdash;and that, while keenly <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>interested in
the pre-historic or proto-historic relics of Clydesdale, he makes
no claim to be regarded as a trained archaeologist, or 
widely-read student.&nbsp; Thus, after Mr. Donnelly found a 
submarine structure at Dumbuck in the estuary of the Clyde, Dr. 
Munro writes: &ldquo;I sent Mr. Donnelly some literature on 
crannogs.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; So Mr. Donnelly, it appears, had
little book lore as to crannogs.&nbsp; He is, in fact, a field 
worker in archaeology, rather than an archaeologist of the study 
and of books.&nbsp; He is a member of a local archaeological 
Society at Helensburgh on the Clyde, and, before he found the 
hill fort of Dunbuie, he had discovered an interesting set of 
&ldquo;cup and ring&rdquo; marked rocks at Auchentorlie, 
&ldquo;only a short distance from Dunbuie.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b" 
class="citation">[13b]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s position, then, as regards archaeological
research, was, in 1896-1898, very like that of Dr. Schliemann 
when he explored Troy.&nbsp; Like Dr. Schliemann he was no 
erudite savant, but an enthusiast with an eye for likely 
sites.&nbsp; Like Dr. Schliemann he discovered certain objects 
hitherto unknown to Science, (at least to Scottish science,) and,
like Dr. Schliemann, he has had to take &ldquo;the consequences 
of being found in such a situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>It must be added that, again like Dr. Schliemann he was 
not an excavator of trained experience.&nbsp; I gather that he 
kept no minute and hourly-dated log-book of his explorations, 
with full details as to the precise positions of the objects 
discovered, while, again like Dr. Schliemann, he had theories of 
his own, with some of which I do not concur.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro justly insists on &ldquo;the absolute necessity of 
correctly recording the facts and relics brought to light by 
excavations.&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a 
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a>&nbsp; An excavator
should be an engineer, or be accompanied by a specialist who can 
assign exact measurements for the position of every object 
discovered.&nbsp; Thus Dr. Munro mentions the case of a man who, 
while digging a drain in his garden in Scotland, found an adze of
jade and a pre-historic urn.&nbsp; Dr. Munro declares, with 
another expert, that the jade adze is &ldquo;a modern Australian 
implement,&rdquo; which is the more amazing as I am not aware 
that the Australians possess any jade.&nbsp; The point is that 
the modern Australian adze was <i>not</i>, as falsely reported, 
in the pre-historic urn. <a name="citation14b"></a><a 
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a></p>
<p>Here I cannot but remark that while Dr. Munro justly regrets 
the absence of record as to precise place of certain finds, he is
not more hospitable to other finds of which the precise locality 
is indicated.&nbsp; <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Things are found by Mr. Bruce as he 
clears out the interior of a canoe, or imbedded in the dock on 
the removal of the canoe, <a name="citation15"></a><a 
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a> or in the 
&ldquo;kitchen midden&rdquo;&mdash;the refuse heap&mdash;but Dr. 
Munro does not esteem the objects more highly because we have a 
distinct record as to the precise place of their finding.</p>
<h2><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>IV&mdash;DUNBUIE</h2>
<p>To return to the site first found, the hill fort of Dunbuie, 
excavated in 1896.&nbsp; Dr. Munro writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no peculiarity about the position 
or structure of this fort which differentiates it from many other
forts in North Britain.&nbsp; Before excavation there were few 
indications that structural remains lay beneath the 
d&eacute;bris, but when this was accomplished there were exposed 
to view the foundations of a circular wall, 13&frac12; feet 
thick, enclosing a space 30 to 32 feet in diameter.&nbsp; Through
this wall there was one entrance passage on a level with its 
base, 3 feet 2 inches in width, protected by two guard chambers, 
one on each side, analogous to those so frequently met with in 
the Brochs.&nbsp; The height of the remaining part of the wall 
varied from 18 inches to 3 feet 6 inches.&nbsp; The interior 
contained no dividing walls nor any indications of secondary 
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus writes Dr. Munro (pp. 130, 131), repeating his remarks on
p. 181 with this addition,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had any remains of intra-mural chambers or 
of a stone stair been detected it would unhesitatingly be 
pronounced a broch; nor, in the absence of such evidence, can it 
be definitely <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>dissociated from that peculiar class 
of Scottish buildings, because the portion of wall then remaining
was not sufficiently high to exclude the possibility of these 
broch characteristics having been present at a higher 
level&mdash;a structural deviation which has occasionally been 
met with.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All the brochs,&rdquo; Dr. Munro goes on, 
&ldquo;hitherto investigated have shown more or less precise 
evidence of a post-Roman civilisation, their range, according to 
Dr. Joseph Anderson, being &ldquo;not earlier than the fifth and 
not later than the ninth century.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17" 
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Although from more recent 
discoveries, as, for example, the broch of Torwodlee, 
Selkirkshire, there is good reason to believe that their range 
might legitimately be brought nearer to Roman times, it makes no 
difference in the correctness of the statement that they all 
belong to the Iron Age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far the &ldquo;broch,&rdquo; or hill fort, was not unlike 
other hill forts and brochs, of which there are hundreds in 
Scotland.&nbsp; But many of the relics alleged to have been found
in the soil of Dunbuie were unfamiliar in character in these 
islands.&nbsp; There was not a shard of pottery, there was not a 
trace of metal, but absence of such things is no proof that they 
were unknown to the inhabitants of the fort.&nbsp; I may go 
further, and say that if any person were capable of interpolating
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>false antiquities, they were equally capable of 
concealing such real antiquities in metal or pottery as they 
might find; to support their theories, or to serve other private 
and obscure ends.</p>
<p>Thus, at Langbank, were found a bronze brooch, and a 
&ldquo;Late Celtic&rdquo; (200 <span 
class="smcap">b.c.</span>?&mdash;<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
comb.&nbsp; These, of course, upset the theory held by some 
inquirers, that the site was Neolithic, that is, was very much 
earlier than the Christian era.&nbsp; If the excavators held that
theory, and were unscrupulous, was it not as easy for them to 
conceal the objects which disproved the hypothesis, as to insert 
the disputed objects&mdash;which do not prove it?</p>
<p>Of course Dr. Munro nowhere suggests that any excavator is the
guilty &ldquo;faker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now quote Dr. Munro&rsquo;s account of the <i>unfamiliar</i>
objects alleged to have been found in Dunbuie.&nbsp; He begins by
citing the late Mr. Adam Millar, F.S.A.Scot., who described 
Dunbuie in the <i>Proceedings S. A. Scot.</i> (vol. <span 
class="smcap">xxx.</span> pp. 291-308.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fort,&rdquo; writes Mr. Millar, 
&ldquo;has been examined very thoroughly by picking out the 
stones in the interior one by one, and riddling the fine soil and
small stones.&nbsp; The same treatment has been applied to the 
refuse heap which was found on the outside, and the result of the
search is a very remarkable collection of weapons, implements, 
ornaments, and figured <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>stones.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no 
description of the precise position of any of these relics in the
ruins, with the exception of two upper stones of querns and a 
limpet shell having on its inner surface the presentation of a 
human face, which are stated to have been found in the interior 
of the fort.&nbsp; No objects of metal or fragments of pottery 
were discovered in course of the excavations, and of bone there 
were only two small pointed objects and an awl having a 
perforation at one end.&nbsp; The majority of the following 
worked objects of stone, bone, and shell are so remarkable and 
archaic in character that their presence in a fort, which cannot 
be placed earlier than the Broch period, and probably long after 
the departure of the Romans from North Britain, has led some 
archaeologists to question their genuineness as relics of any 
phase of Scottish civilisation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Objects of Stone</span>.&mdash;Nine 
spear-heads, like arrow-points, of slate, six of which have 
linear patterns scratched on them.&nbsp; Some are perforated with
round holes, and all were made by grinding and polishing.&nbsp; 
One object of slate, shaped like a knife, was made by 
chipping.&nbsp; &ldquo;This knife,&rdquo; says Mr. Millar, 
&ldquo;has a feature common to all these slate weapons&mdash;they
seem to have been saturated with oil or fat, as water does not 
adhere to them, but runs off as from a greasy 
surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another highly ornamental piece of cannel 
coal is in the form of a short spear-head with a thickish 
stem.&nbsp; The stem is adorned with a series of hollows and 
ridges running across it; radiating lines running from the stem 
to the margin.&nbsp; Another group of these remarkable objects 
shows markings of the cup-and-ring order, circles, linear 
incisions, and perforations.&nbsp; Some of these ornamentations 
are deeply cut on the naturally rough surfaces of flat pieces of 
sandstone, whilst others are on smooth stones artificially 
prepared for the purpose.&nbsp; A small piece of <!-- page 
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>flint
was supposed to have been inserted into a partially burnt 
handle.&nbsp; There are several examples of hammer-stones of the 
ordinary crannog type, rubbing-stones, whetstones, as well as a 
large number of water-worn stones which might have been used as 
hand-missiles or sling-stones.&nbsp; These latter were not native
to the hill, and must have been transported from burns in the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; There are also two upper quern stones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous Objects</span>.&mdash;A 
number of splintered pieces of bone, without showing any other 
evidence of workmanship, have linear incisions, like those on 
some of the stones, which suggest some kind of cryptic writing 
like ogams.&nbsp; There are also a few water-worn shells, like 
those seen on a sandy beach, having round holes bored through 
them and sharply-cut scratches on their pearly inner 
surface.&nbsp; But on the whole the edible molluscs are but 
feebly represented, as only five oyster, one cockle, three 
limpet, and two mussel shells were found, nearly all of which 
bore marks of some kind of ornamentation.&nbsp; But perhaps the 
most grotesque object in the whole collection is the limpet shell
with a human face sculptured on its inner surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes,&rdquo; writes Mr. Millar, &ldquo;are 
represented by two holes, the nose by sharply-cut lines, and the 
mouth by a well-drawn waved line, the curves which we call 
Cupid&rsquo;s bow being faithfully followed.&nbsp; There is 
nothing at all of an archaic character, however, in this example 
of shell-carving.&nbsp; We found it in the interior of the fort; 
it was one of the early finds&mdash;nothing like it has been 
found since; at the same time we have no reason for assuming that
this shell was placed in the fort on purpose that we might find 
it.&nbsp; The fact that it was taken out of the fort is all that 
we say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Millar&rsquo;s opinion of these novel handicraft remains 
was that they were the products of a pre-Celtic 
civilisation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>articles 
found,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are strongly indicative of a much
earlier period than post-Roman; they point to an occupation of a 
tribe in their Stone Age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no knowledge of the precise position in which 
the &lsquo;queer things&rsquo; of Dunbuie were found, with the 
exception of the limpet shell showing the carved human face 
which, according to a recent statement in the <i>Journal of the 
British Archaeological Association</i>, September, 1901, 
&ldquo;was excavated from a crevice in the living rock, over 
which tons of debris had rested.&nbsp; When taken out, the 
incrustations of dirt prevented any carving from being seen; it 
was only after being dried and cleaned that the 
&lsquo;face&rsquo; appeared, as well as the suspension holes on 
each side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, this unique piece of art was in the fort before it became 
a ruin and otherwise presented evidence of great antiquity; but 
yet it is stated in Mr. Millar&rsquo;s report that there was 
&ldquo;nothing at all of an archaic character in this example of 
shell-carving.&rdquo; <a name="citation21"></a><a 
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have nothing to do with statements made in <i>The Journal of
the British Archaeological Association</i> about &ldquo;<i>a 
carved oyster shell</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stick to the limpet shell
of Mr. Millar, which, to my eyes looks anything but archaic.</p>

22</span>V&mdash;HOW I CAME INTO THE CONTROVERSY</h2>
<p>Thus far, I was so much to be sympathised with as never to 
have heard of the names of Dunbuie and of Mr. Donnelly.&nbsp; In 
this ignorance I remained till late in October or early in 
November 1898.&nbsp; On an afternoon of that date I was reading 
the proof sheets, kindly lent to me by Messrs. Macmillan, of 
<i>The Native Tribes of Central Australia</i> by Messrs. Spencer 
and Gillen, a work, now justly celebrated, which was published 
early in 1899.&nbsp; I was much interested on finding, in this 
book, that certain tribes of Central Australia,&mdash;the Arunta 
&ldquo;nation&rdquo; and the Kaitish,&mdash;<i>paint</i> on 
sacred and other rocks the very same sorts of archaic designs as 
Mr. Donnelly found <i>incised</i> at Auchentorlie (of which I had
not then heard).&nbsp; These designs are familiar in many other 
parts of Scotland and of the world.&nbsp; They play a great part 
in the initiations and magic of Central Australia.&nbsp; Designs 
of the same class are incised, by the same Australian tribes, on 
stones of various <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>shapes and sizes, usually portable, 
and variously shaped which are styled <i>churinga 
nanja</i>.&nbsp; (<i>Churinga</i> merely means anything 
&ldquo;sacred,&rdquo; that is, with a superstitious sense 
attached to it).&nbsp; They also occur on wooden slats, 
(<i>churinga irula</i>,) commonly styled &ldquo;Bull 
roarers&rdquo; by Europeans.&nbsp; The tribes are now in a 
&ldquo;siderolithic&rdquo; stage, using steel when they can get 
it, stone when they cannot.&nbsp; If ever they come to abandon 
stone implements, while retaining their magic or religion, they 
will keep on using their stone <i>churinga nanja</i>.</p>
<p>While I was studying these novel Australian facts, in the 
autumn of 1898, a friend, a distinguished member of Clan 
Diarmaid, passing by my window, in London, saw me, and came 
in.&nbsp; He at once began to tell me that, in the estuary of the
Clyde, and at Dunbuie, some one had found small stones, marked 
with the same archaic kinds of patterns, 
&ldquo;cup-and-ring,&rdquo; half circles, and so forth, as exist 
on our inscribed rocks, cists, and other large objects.&nbsp; I 
then showed him the illustrations of portable stones in 
Australia, with archaic patterns, not then published, but figured
in the proof sheets of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen&rsquo;s 
work.&nbsp; My friend told me, later, that he had seen small 
stone incised with concentric circles, found in the excavation of
a hill fort near Tarbert, in Kintyre.&nbsp; He made a sketch of 
this object, from <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>memory: if found in Central Australia
it would have been reckoned a <i>churinga nanja</i>.</p>
<p>I was naturally much interested in my friend&rsquo;s account 
of objects found in the Clyde estuary, which, <i>as far as his 
description went</i>, resembled in being archaically decorated 
the <i>churinga nanja</i> discovered by Messrs. Spencer and 
Gillen in Central Australia.&nbsp; I wrote an article on the 
subject of the archaic decorative designs, as found all over the 
world, for the <i>Contemporary Review</i>. <a 
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24" 
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; I had then seen only pen and ink 
sketches of the objects, sent to me by Mr. Donnelly, and a few 
casts, which I passed on to an eminent authority.&nbsp; One of 
the casts showed a round stone with concentric circles.&nbsp; I 
know not what became of the original or of the casts.</p>
<p>While correcting proofs of this article, I read in the 
<i>Glasgow Herald</i> (January 7, 1899) a letter by Dr. Munro, 
impugning the authenticity of one set of finds by Mr. Donnelly, 
in a pile-structure at Dumbuck, on the Clyde, near 
Dumbarton.&nbsp; I wrote to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>, adducing 
the Australian <i>churinga nanja</i> as parallel to Mr. 
Donnelly&rsquo;s inscribed stones, and thus my share in the 
controversy began.&nbsp; What Dr. Munro and I then wrote may be 
passed over in this place.</p>
<h2><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>VI&mdash;DUMBUCK</h2>
<p>It was in July 1898, that Mr. Donnelly, who had been 
prospecting during two years for antiquities in the Clyde 
estuary, found at low tide, certain wooden stumps, projecting out
of the mud at low water.&nbsp; On August 16, 1898, Dr. Munro, 
with Mr. Donnelly, inspected these stumps, &ldquo;before 
excavations were made.&rdquo; <a name="citation25a"></a><a 
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; It is not 
easy to describe concisely the results of their inspection, and 
of the excavations which followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;So far the 
facts&rdquo; (of the site, not of the alleged relics), 
&ldquo;though highly interesting as evidence of the hand of man 
in the early navigation of the Clyde basin present nothing very 
remarkable or important,&rdquo; says Dr. Munro. <a 
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b" 
class="citation">[25b]</a></p>
<p>I shall here quote Dr. Munro&rsquo;s descriptions of what he 
himself observed at two visits, of August 16, October 12, 1898, 
to Dumbuck.&nbsp; For the <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>present I 
omit some speculative passages as to the original purpose of the 
structure.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The so-called Dumbuck 
&lsquo;crannog,&rsquo; that being the most convenient name under 
which to describe the submarine wooden structures lately 
discovered by Mr. W. A. Donnelly in the estuary of the Clyde, 
lies about a mile to the east of the rock of Dumbarton, and about
250 yards within high-water mark.&nbsp; At every tide its site is
covered with water to a depth of three to eight feet, but at low 
tide it is left high and dry for a few hours, so that it was only
during these tidal intervals that the excavations could be 
conducted.</p>
<p>On the occasion of my first visit to Dumbuck, before 
excavations were begun, Mr. Donnelly and I counted twenty-seven 
piles of oak, some 5 or 8 inches in diameter, cropping up for a 
few inches through the mud, in the form of a circle 56 feet in 
diameter.&nbsp; The area thus enclosed was occupied with the 
trunks of small trees laid horizontally close to each other and 
directed towards the centre, and so superficial that portions of 
them were exposed above the surrounding mud, but all hollows and 
interstices were levelled up with sand or mud.&nbsp; The tops of 
the piles which projected above the surface of the log-pavement 
were considerably worn by the continuous action of the muddy 
waters during the ebb and flow of the tides, a fact which 
suggested the following remarkable hypothesis: &lsquo;Their tops 
are shaped in an oval, conical form, meant to make a joint in a 
socket to erect the superstructure on.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words 
are quoted from a &lsquo;Report of a Conjoint Visit of the 
Geological and Philosophical Societies to the Dumbuck Crannog, 
8th April, 1899.&rsquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a 
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>The result of the excavations, so far as I can gather from 
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>observations made during my second visit to the 
&lsquo;crannog,&rsquo; and the descriptions and plans published 
by various societies, may be briefly stated as follows.</p>
<p>The log-pavement within the circle of piles was the upper of 
three similar layers of timbers placed one above the other, the 
middle layer having its beams lying transversely to that 
immediately above and below it.&nbsp; One of the piles (about 4 
feet long) when freshly drawn up, clearly showed that it had been
pointed by a sharp metal implement, the cutting marks being like 
those produced by an ordinary axe.&nbsp; The central portion 
(about 6 feet in diameter) had no woodwork, and the circular 
cavity thus formed, when cleared of fallen stones, showed 
indications of having been walled with stones and clay.&nbsp; 
Surrounding this walled cavity&mdash;the so-called 
&lsquo;well&rsquo; of the explorers, there was a kind of coping, 
in the form of five or six &lsquo;raised mounds,&rsquo; arranged 
&lsquo;rosette fashion,&rsquo; in regard to which Mr. Donnelly 
thus writes:</p>
<p>&lsquo;One feature that strikes me very much in the 
configuration of the structure in the centre is those places 
marked X, fig. 20, around which I have discovered the presence of
soft wood piles 5 inches in diameter driven into the ground, and 
bounding the raised stone arrangement; the stones in these rude 
circular pavements or cairns are laid slightly slanting 
inwards.&rsquo; <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" 
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>From this description, and especially the &lsquo;slanting 
inwards&rsquo; of these &lsquo;circular pavements&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;cairns,&rsquo; it would appear that they formed the bases 
for wooden stays to support a great central pole, a suggestion 
which, on different grounds, has already been made by Dr. David 
Murray.</p>
<p>The surrounding piles were also attached to the horizontal 
logs by various ingenious contrivances, such as a fork, a natural
bend, an artificial check, or a mortised hole; and some of the 
beams were pinned together by tree-nails, the perforations of 
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>which were unmistakable.&nbsp; This binding together of 
the wooden structures is a well-known feature in crannogs, as was
demonstrated by my investigations at Lochlee and elsewhere. <a 
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a" 
class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; It would be still more necessary
in a substratum of timbers that was intended (as will be 
afterwards explained) to bear the weight of a superincumbent 
cairn.&nbsp; Underneath the layers of horizontal woodwork some 
portions of heather, bracken, and brushwood were detected, and 
below this came a succession of thin beds of mud, loam, sand, 
gravel, and finally the blue clay which forms the solum of the 
river valley. <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b" 
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; The piles penetrated this 
latter, but not deeply, owing to its consistency; and so the blue
clay formed an excellent foundation for a structure whose main 
object was resistance to superincumbent pressure.</p>
<p>Outside the circle of piles there was, at a distance of 12 to 
14 feet, another wooden structure in the shape of a broad ring of
horizontal beams and piles which surrounded the central 
area.&nbsp; The breadth of this outer ring was 7 feet, and it 
consisted of some nine rows of beams running 
circumferentially.&nbsp; Beyond this lay scattered about some 
rough cobble stones, as if they had fallen down from a stone 
structure which had been raised over the woodwork.&nbsp; The 
space intervening between these wooden structures was filled up 
in its eastern third with a refuse heap, consisting of broken and
partially burnt bones of various animals, the shells of edible 
molluscs, and a quantity of ashes and charcoal, evidently the 
d&eacute;bris of human occupancy.&nbsp; On the north, or landward
side, the outer and inner basements of woodwork appeared to 
coalesce for 5 or 6 yards, leaving an open space having stones 
embedded in the mud and decayed wood, a condition of things which
suggested a rude causeway.&nbsp; When Mr. Donnelly drew my 
attention to this, I <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>demurred to its being so 
characterised owing to its indefiniteness.&nbsp; At the outer 
limit of this so-called causeway, and about 25 feet north-east of
the circle of piles, a canoe was discovered lying in a kind of 
dock, rudely constructed of side stones and wooden piling.&nbsp; 
The canoe measures 35&frac12; feet long, 4 feet broad, and 
1&frac12; foot deep.&nbsp; It has a square stern with a movable 
board, two grasping holes near the stem, and three round 
perforations (2 inches in diameter) in its bottom.&nbsp; On the 
north-west border of the log-pavement a massive ladder of oak was
found, one end resting on the margin of the log-pavement and the 
other projecting obliquely into the timberless zone between the 
former and the outer woodwork.&nbsp; It is thus described in the 
<i>Proceedings of the Glasgow Philosophical Society</i>:<a 
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29" 
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Made of a slab of oak which has been split from the 
tree by wedges (on one side little has been done to dress the 
work), it is 15 feet 3 inches long, 2 feet broad, and 3&frac12; 
inches thick.&nbsp; Six holes are cut for steps, 12 inches by 10 
inches; the bottom of each is bevelled to an angle of 60 degrees 
to make the footing level when the ladder is in position.&nbsp; 
On one side those holes show signs of wear by long 
use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An under quern stone, 19 inches in diameter, was found about 
halfway between the canoe and the margin of the circle of piles, 
and immediately to the east of the so-called causeway already 
described.</p>
<p>I carefully examined the surface of the log-pavement with the 
view of finding evidence as to the possibility of its having been
at any time the habitable area of this strange dwelling-place; 
but the result was absolutely negative, as not a single particle 
of bone or ash was discovered in any of its chinks.&nbsp; This 
fact, together with the impossibility of living on a surface that
is submerged every twelve hours, and the improbability of <!-- 
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
30</span>any land subsidence having taken place since prehistoric
times, or any adequate depression from the shrinkage of the 
under-structures themselves, compels me to summarily reject the 
theory that the Dumbuck structure in its present form was an 
ordinary crannog.&nbsp; The most probable hypothesis, and that 
which supplies a reasonable explanation of all the facts, is that
the woodwork was the foundation of a superstructure of stones 
built sufficiently high to be above the action of the tides and 
waves, over which there had been some kind of 
dwelling-place.&nbsp; The unique arrangement of the wooden 
substructures suggests that the central building was in the form 
of a round tower with very thick walls, like the brochs and other
forts of North Britain.&nbsp; The central space was probably 
occupied with a pole, firmly fixed at its base in the 
&lsquo;well,&rsquo; and kept in position by suitable stays, 
resting partly on the stone &lsquo;cairns&rsquo; already 
described, partly in wooden sockets fixed into the log-pavement, 
and partly on the inner wall of the tower.&nbsp; This suggestion 
seems to me to be greatly strengthened by the following 
description of some holed tree-roots in Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s paper 
to the Scottish Antiquaries: <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Midway between the centre and the outside piles of the 
structure what looked at first to be tree-roots or snags were 
noticed partly imbedded in the sand.&nbsp; On being washed of the
adhering soil, holes of 12 inches wide by 25 inches deep were 
found cut in them at an angle, to all appearance for the 
insertion of struts for the support of an upper structure.&nbsp; 
On the outside, 14 inches down on either side, holes of 2 inches 
diameter were found intersecting the central hole, apparently for
the insertion of a wooden key or trenail to retain the 
struts.&nbsp; These were found at intervals, and were held in 
position by stones and smaller jammers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The outer woodwork formed the foundation of another <!-- page 
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>stone
structure, of a horseshoe shape, having the open side to the 
north or landside of the tower, which doubtless was intended as a
breakwater.&nbsp; By means of the ladder placed slantingly 
against the wall of the central stone building access could be 
got to the top in all states of the tides.</p>
<p>The people who occupied this watch-tower ground their own 
corn, and fared abundantly on beef, mutton, pork, venison, and 
shell-fish.&nbsp; The food refuse and other debris were thrown 
into the space between the central structure and the breakwater, 
forming in the course of time a veritable kitchen-midden.</p>
<p>Besides the causeway on the north side, Mr. Bruce describes 
&lsquo;a belt of stones, forming a pavement about six feet wide 
and just awash with the mud,&rsquo; extending westwards about 
twenty yards from the central cavity, till it intersected the 
breakwater. <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31" 
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; These so-called pavements and 
causeways were probably formed during the construction of the 
tower with its central pole, or perhaps at the time of its 
demolition, as it would be manifestly inconvenient to transport 
stones to or from such a place, in the midst of so much slush, 
without first making some kind of firm pathway.&nbsp; Their 
present superficial position alone demonstrates the absurdity of 
assigning the Dumbuck structures to Neolithic times, as if the 
only change effected in the bed of the Clyde since then would be 
the deposition of a few inches of mud.&nbsp; At a little distance
to the west of these wooden structures there is the terminal end 
of a modern ditch (&lsquo;the burn&rsquo; of Mr. Alston), 
extending towards the shore, and having on its eastern bank a row
of stepping-stones; a fact which, in my opinion, partly accounts 
for the demolition of the stonework, which formerly stood over 
them.&nbsp; So far, the facts <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>disclosed by 
the excavations of the structures at Dumbuck, though highly 
interesting as evidence of the hand of man in the early 
navigation of the Clyde basin, present nothing very remarkable or
improbable.&nbsp; It is when we come to examine the strange 
relics which the occupants of this habitation have left behind 
them that the real difficulties begin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Munro next describes the disputed things found at 
Dumbuck.&nbsp; They were analogous to those alleged to have been 
unearthed at Dunbuie.&nbsp; They were</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A number of strange objects like 
spear-heads or daggers, showing more or less workmanship, and 
variously ornamented.&nbsp; One great spear-head (figure 1), like
an arrow-point, is 11 inches long and 4&frac34; inches wide at 
the barbs.&nbsp; The stem is perforated with two holes, in one of
which there was a portion of an oak pin.&nbsp; It has a flat body
and rounded edges, and is carefully finished by rubbing and 
grinding.&nbsp; One surface is ornamented with three cup-marks 
from which lines radiate like stars or suns, and the other has 
only small cups and a few transverse lines.&nbsp; There are some 
shaped stones, sometimes perforated for suspension, made of the 
same material; while another group of similar objects is made of 
cannel coal.&nbsp; All these are highly ornamented by a fantastic
combination of circles, dots, lines, cup-and-rings with or 
without gutters, and perforations.&nbsp; A small pebble (plate 
<span class="smcap">xv.</span> no. 10) shows, on one side, a boat
with three men plying their oars, and on the other an incised 
outline of a left hand having a small cup-and-ring in the 
palm.&nbsp; The most sensational objects in the collection are, 
however, four rude figures, cut out of shale (figs. 50-53), 
representing portions of the human face and person.&nbsp; One, 
evidently a female (figure 2), we are informed was found at the 
bottom of the kitchen midden, a strange resting-place <!-- page 
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>for a
goddess; the other three are grotesque efforts to represent a 
human face.&nbsp; There are also several oyster-shells, 
ornamented like some of the shale ornaments, and very similar to 
the oyster-shell ornaments of Dunbuie.&nbsp; A splinter of a hard
stone is inserted into the tine of a deer-horn as a handle (plate
xiii. no. 5); and another small blunt implement (no. 1) has a 
bone handle.&nbsp; A few larger stones with cup-marks and some 
portions of partially worked pieces of shale complete the art 
gallery of Dumbuck.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed as if some curse were on Mr. Donnelly!&nbsp; Whether
he discovered an unique old site of human existence in the water 
or on the land, some viewless fiend kept sowing the soil with 
<i>bizarre</i> objects unfamiliar to Dr. Munro, and by him deemed
incongruous with the normal and known features of human life on 
such sites.</p>
<h2><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>VII&mdash;LANGBANK</h2>
<p>The Curse, (that is, the forger,) unwearied and relentless, 
next smote Mr. John Bruce, F.S.A.Scot., merely, as it seems, 
because he and Mr. Donnelly were partners in the perfectly 
legitimate pastime of archaeological exploration.&nbsp; Mr. 
Bruce&rsquo;s share of the trouble began at Dumbuck.&nbsp; The 
canoe was found, the genuine canoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was at once 
cleared out by myself,&rdquo; writes Mr. Bruce.&nbsp; In the 
bottom of the canoe he found &ldquo;a spear-shaped slate 
object,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an ornamented oyster shell, which has 
since mouldered away,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a stone pendant object, 
and an implement of bone.&rdquo; <a name="citation34"></a><a 
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>Such objects have no business to be found in a canoe just 
discovered under the mud of Clyde, and cleared out by Mr. Bruce 
himself, a man or affairs, and of undisputed probity.&nbsp; In 
this case the precise site of the dubious relics is given, by a 
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>man of honour, at first hand.&nbsp; I confess that my 
knowledge of human nature does not enable me to contest Mr. 
Bruce&rsquo;s written attestation, while I marvel at the 
astuteness of the forger.&nbsp; As a finder, on this occasion, 
Mr. Bruce was in precisely the same position as Dr. Munro at Elie
when, as he says, &ldquo;as the second piece of pottery was 
disinterred by myself, I was able to locate its precise position 
at six inches below the surface of the relic bed.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35" 
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Bruce was able to locate 
<i>his</i> finds at the bottom of the canoe.</p>
<p>If I understand Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s narrative, a canoe was found
under the mud, and was &ldquo;cleared out inside,&rdquo; by Mr. 
Bruce himself.&nbsp; Had the forger already found the canoe, kept
the discovery dark, inserted fraudulent objects, and waited for 
others to rediscover the canoe?&nbsp; Or was he present at the 
first discovery, and did he subtly introduce, unnoted by any one,
four objects of shell, stone, and bone, which he had up his 
sleeve, ready for an opportunity?&nbsp; One or other alternative 
must be correct, and either hypothesis has its difficulties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sir Arthur Mitchell, not a credulous savant, says: 
&ldquo;The evidence of authenticity in regard to these doubted 
objects from Dumbuck <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>is the usual evidence in such 
circumstances . . . it is precisely the same evidence of 
authenticity which is furnished in regard to all the classes of 
objects found in the Dumbuck exploration&mdash;that is, in regard
to the canoe, the quern, the bones etc.&mdash;about the 
authenticity of which no doubts have been expressed, as in regard
to objects about which doubts have been expressed.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a" 
class="citation">[36a]</a></p>
<p>Of another object found by a workman at Dumbuck Dr. Munro 
writes &ldquo;is it not very remarkable that a workman, groping 
with his hand in the mud, should accidentally stumble on this 
relic&mdash;the only one found in this part of the site?&nbsp; Is
it possible that he was an unconscious thought-reader, and was 
thus guided to make the discovery&rdquo; of a thing which 
&ldquo;could as readily have been inserted there half-an-hour 
before?&rdquo; <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b" 
class="citation">[36b]</a></p>
<p>This passage is &ldquo;rote sarcustic.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely
Dr. Munro will not, he cannot, argue that Mr. Bruce was &ldquo;an
unconscious thought-reader&rdquo; when <i>he</i> &ldquo;cleared 
out&rdquo; the interior of the canoe, and found three disputed 
objects &ldquo;in the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are to be &ldquo;psychical,&rdquo; there seems less 
evidence for &ldquo;unconscious thought-reading,&rdquo; than <!--
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>for the presence of what are technically styled 
<i>apports</i>,&mdash;things introduced by an agency of 
supra-normal character, vulgarly called a 
&ldquo;spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undeterred by an event which might have struck fear <i>in 
constantem virum</i>, Mr. Bruce, in the summer of 1901, was so 
reckless as to discover a fresh &ldquo;submarine wooden 
structure&rdquo; at Langbank, on the left, or south bank of the 
Clyde Estuary opposite Dumbarton Castle.&nbsp; The dangerous 
object was cautiously excavated under the superintendence of Mr. 
Bruce, and a committee of the Glasgow Archaeological 
Society.&nbsp; To be brief, the larger features were akin to 
those of Dumbuck, without the central &ldquo;well,&rdquo; or 
hole, supposed by Dr. Munro to have held the pole of a 
beacon-cairn.&nbsp; The wooden piles, as at Dumbuck, had been 
fashioned by &ldquo;sharp metal tools.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37" 
class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; This is Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s own 
opinion.&nbsp; This evidence of the use of metal tools is a great
point of Dr. Munro, against such speculative minds as deem 
Dumbuck and Langbank &ldquo;neolithic,&rdquo; that is, of a date 
long before the Christian era.&nbsp; <i>They</i> urged that stone
tools could have fashioned the piles, but I know not that 
partisans of either opinion have made experiments in hewing trees
with stone-headed axes, like the ingenious Monsieur <!-- page 
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>Hippolyte M&uuml;ller in France. <a 
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a" 
class="citation">[38a]</a>&nbsp; I am, at present, of opinion 
that all the sites are of an age in which iron was well known to 
the natives, and bronze was certainly known.</p>
<p>The relics at Langbank were (1) of a familiar, and (2) of an 
unfamiliar kind.&nbsp; There was (1) a small bone comb with a 
&ldquo;Late Celtic&rdquo; (200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>-? 
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) design of circles and segments 
of circles; there was a very small penannular brooch of brass or 
bronze; there were a few cut fragments of deer horn, pointed 
bones, stone polishers, and so forth, all familiar to science and
acceptable. <a name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b" 
class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Curse fell on Mr. Bruce in the shape of
two perforated shale objects: on one was cut a grotesque face, on
the other two incomplete concentric circles, &ldquo;a stem line 
with little nicks,&rdquo; and two vague incised marks, which may,
or may not, represent &ldquo;fragments of deer horn.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c" 
class="citation">[38c]</a></p>
<p>We learn from Mr. Bruce that he first observed the Langbank 
circle of stones from the window of a passing train, and that he 
made a few slight excavations, apparently at the end of 
September, 1901.&nbsp; More formal research was made in October; 
and again, under the superintendence of members of the Glasgow 
Archaeological Society, <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>in September, October, 1902.&nbsp; No
members of the Glasgow Committee were present when either the 
undisputed Late Celtic comb, or the inscribed, perforated, and 
disputed pieces of cannel coal were discovered.&nbsp; 
Illustrations of these objects and of the bronze penannular ring 
are here given, (figures 1, 2, 3, 4), (two shale objects are 
omitted,) by the kindness of the Glasgow Archaeological Society 
(<i>Transactions</i>, vol. v. p. 1).</p>
<p>The brooch (allowed to be genuine) &ldquo;might date from 
Romano-British times, say 100-400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
to any date up to late mediaeval times.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39" 
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; Good evidence to date, in a wide 
sense, would be the &ldquo;osseous remains,&rdquo; the bones left
in the refuse at Langbank and Dumbuck.&nbsp; Of the bones, I only
gather as peculiarly interesting, that Dr. Bryce has found those 
of <i>Bos Longifrons</i>.&nbsp; Of <i>Bos Longifrons</i> as a 
proof of date, I know little.&nbsp; Mr. Ridgeway, Disney 
Professor of Archaeology in the University of Cambridge, is not 
&ldquo;a merely literary man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his work <i>The 
Early Age of Greece</i>, vol. i., pp. 334, 335 (Cambridge 
University Press, 1901), Mr. Ridgeway speaks of <i>Bos</i> as the
Celtic ox, co-eval with the Swiss Lake Dwellings, and known as 
<i>Bos brachyceros</i>&mdash;&ldquo;short horn&rdquo;&mdash;so 
styled by Rutimeyer.&nbsp; If he is &ldquo;Celtic&rdquo; I <!-- 
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>cannot say how early <i>Bos</i> may have existed among 
the Celts of Britain, but the Romans are thought by some persons 
to have brought the Celtic ox to the Celts of our island.&nbsp; 
If this be so, the Clyde sites are not earlier (or <i>Bos</i> in 
these sites is not earlier) than the Roman invasion.&nbsp; He 
lasted into the seventh or eighth centuries <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span> at least, and is found on a site 
discovered by Dr. Munro at Elie. <a name="citation40a"></a><a 
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Meanwhile 
archaeology is so lazy, that, after seven years, Dr. 
Bryce&rsquo;s &ldquo;reports on the osseous remains&rdquo; of 
Langbank and Dumbuck is but lately published. <a

</a></p>
<p>Dr. Bryce, in his report to the Glasgow Archaeological 
Society, says that &ldquo;<i>Bos Longifrons</i> has a wide range 
in time, from Neolithic down to perhaps even medieval 
times.&nbsp; It was the domestic ox in Scotland for an unknown 
period, before, during, and for an unknown time after the Roman 
invasion. . . .&nbsp; The occurrence of extinct, probably long 
extinct, breeds, and these only, make the phenomena in this 
respect at Langbank exactly comparable with those observed at 
sites of pile buildings in Scotland generally, and thus it 
becomes indirect evidence against the thesis that the structure 
belongs to some different category, and to quite recent 
times.&rdquo; <a name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"

<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>The evidence of the bones, then, denotes any date except
a relatively recent date, of 1556-1758; contrary to an hypothesis
to be touched on later.&nbsp; It follows, from the presence of 
<i>Bos</i> at Elie (700 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) that the
occupants of the Clyde sites at Langbank may have lived there as 
late as, say, 750 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; But when 
they <i>began</i> to occupy the sites is another question.</p>

<p>If Roman objects are found, as they are, in brochs which show 
many relics of bronze, it does not follow that the brochs had not
existed for centuries before the inhabitants acquired the waifs 
and strays of Roman civilisation.&nbsp; In the Nine Caithness 
Brochs described by Dr. Joseph Anderson, <a 
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41" 
class="citation">[41]</a> there was a crucible . . . with a 
portion of melted bronze, a bronze ring, moulds for ingots, an 
ingot of bronze, bits of Roman &ldquo;Samian ware,&rdquo; but no 
iron.&nbsp; We can be sure that the broch folk were at some time 
in touch of Roman goods, brought by traffickers perhaps, but how 
can we be sure that there were no brochs before the arrival of 
the Romans?</p>
<p>We shall return to the question of the disputable relics of 
the Clyde, after discussing what science has to say about the 
probable date and original purpose of the wooden structures in 
the <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>Clyde estuary.&nbsp; Nobody, it is admitted, forged 
<i>them</i>, but on the other hand Dr. Munro, the one most 
learned authority on &ldquo;Lake Dwellings,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;Crannogs,&rdquo; does not think that the sites were ever 
occupied by regular &ldquo;crannogs,&rdquo; or lacustrine 
settlements, Lake Dwellings.</p>
<h2><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>VIII&mdash;THE ORIGINAL DATE AND PURPOSE OF DUMBUCK AND 
LANGBANK</h2>
<p>The actual structures of Langbank and Dumbuck, then, are 
confessedly ancient remains; they are <i>not</i> of the 
nineteenth century; they are &ldquo;unique&rdquo; in our 
knowledge, and we ask, what was the purpose of their 
constructors, and what is their approximate date?</p>
<p>Dr. Munro quotes and discusses <a name="citation43"></a><a 
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a> a theory, or a 
tentative guess of Dr. David Murray.&nbsp; That scholar writes 
&ldquo;River cairns are commonly built on piled platforms, <i>and
my doubt is</i> whether this is not the nature of the structure 
in question&rdquo; (Dumbuck).&nbsp; A river cairn is a solid pile
of stonework, with, perhaps, a pole in the centre.&nbsp; At 
Dumbuck there is the central &ldquo;well&rdquo; of six feet in 
diameter.&nbsp; Dr. Murray says that a pole &ldquo;carried down 
to the bottom would probably be sunk in <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the clay, 
which would produce a hole, or well-like cavity similar to that 
of the Dumbuck structure.&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a 
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>It is not stated that the poles of river cairns usually demand
accommodation to the extent of six feet of diameter, in the 
centre of the solid mass of stones, and, as the Langbank site has
no central well, the tentative conjecture that it was a river 
cairn is not put forward.&nbsp; Dr. Murray suggests that the 
Dumbuck cairn &ldquo;may have been one of the works of 1556 or 
1612,&rdquo; that is, of the modern age of Queen Mary and James 
VI.&nbsp; The object of such Corporation cairns &ldquo;was no 
doubt to mark the limit of their jurisdiction, and also to serve 
as a beacon to vessels coming up the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Corporation, with its jurisdiction and beacons, is 
purely modern.&nbsp; In 1758 the Corporation had a &ldquo;lower 
cairn, if it did not occupy this very spot&rdquo; (Dumbuck) 
&ldquo;it stood upon the same line and close to it.&nbsp; There 
are, however, no remains of such cairn,&rdquo; says Dr. 
Murray.&nbsp; He cites no evidence for the date and expenses of 
the demolition of the cairn from any municipal book of 
accounts.</p>
<p>Now we have to ask (1) Is there any evidence <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>that men in 
1556-1758 lived on the tops of such modern cairns, dating from 
the reign of Mary Stuart?&nbsp; (2) If men then lived on the top 
of a cairn till their food refuse became &ldquo;a veritable 
kitchen midden,&rdquo; as Dr. Munro says, <a 
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45" 
class="citation">[45]</a> would that refuse exhibit bones of 
<i>Bos Longifrons</i>; and over ninety bone implements, sharpened
antlers of deer, stone polishers, hammer stones, &ldquo;a saddle 
stone&rdquo; for corn grinding, and the usual 
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of sites of the fifth to the twelfth 
centuries?&nbsp; (3) Would such a modern site exhibit these 
archaic relics, plus a &ldquo;Late Celtic&rdquo; comb and 
&ldquo;penannular brooch,&rdquo; and exhibit not one modern 
article of metal, or one trace of old clay tobacco pipes, 
crockery, or glass?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are obvious.&nbsp; It is not 
shown that any men ever lived on the tops of cairns, and, even if
they did so in modern times (1556-1758) they could not leave 
abundant relics of the broch and crannog age (said to be of 
400-1100 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), and leave no relics of
modern date.&nbsp; This theory, or suggestion, is therefore 
demonstrably untenable and unimaginable.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro, however, &ldquo;sees nothing against the 
supposition&rdquo; that &ldquo;Dr. Murray is right,&rdquo; but 
Dr. Munro&rsquo;s remarks about the hypothesis <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of modern 
cairns, as a theory &ldquo;against which he sees nothing,&rdquo; 
have the air of being an inadvertent <i>obiter dictum</i>.&nbsp; 
For, in his conclusion and summing up he writes, &ldquo;We claim 
to have established that the structures of Dunbuie, Dumbuck, and 
Langbank are remains of inhabited sites of the early-Iron Age, 
dating to some time between the fifth and twelfth 
centuries.&rdquo; <a name="citation46a"></a><a 
href="#footnote46a" class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; I accept 
this conclusion, and will say as little as may be about the 
theory of a modern <i>origin</i> of the sites, finally discarded 
by Dr. Munro.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;discarded,&rdquo; for his theory
is that the modern corporation utilised an earlier structure as a
cairn or beacon, or boundary mark, which is perfectly 
possible.&nbsp; But, if this occurred, it does not affect the 
question, for this use of the structure has left no traces of any
kind.&nbsp; There are no relics, except relics of the fifth (?) 
to twelfth (?) centuries.</p>
<p>In an earlier work by Dr. Munro, <i>Prehistoric Scotland</i> 
(p. 439), published in 1899, he observes that we have no evidence
as to the when, or how of the removal of the stones of the 
hypothetical &ldquo;Corporation cairn,&rdquo; or &ldquo;round 
tower with very thick walls,&rdquo; <a name="citation46b"></a><a 
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a> or &ldquo;watch 
tower,&rdquo; which is supposed to have been erected above the 
wooden sub-structure <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>at Dumbuck.&nbsp; He tentatively 
suggests that the stones may have been used, perhaps, for the 
stone causeway now laid along the bank of the recently made 
canal, from a point close to the crannog to the railway.&nbsp; No
record is cited.&nbsp; He now offers guesses as to the stones 
&ldquo;in the so-called pavements and causeways.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
First, the causeways may have probably been made &ldquo;during 
the construction of the tower with its central pole,&rdquo; (here
the cairn is a habitable beacon, habitable on all hypotheses,) 
or, again, &ldquo;perhaps at the time of its demolition&rdquo; 
about which demolition we know nothing, <a 
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a" 
class="citation">[47a]</a> except that the most of the stones are
not now <i>in situ.</i></p>
<p>Several authentic stone crannogs in Scotland, as to which we 
have information, possessed no central pole, but had a stone 
causeway, still extant, leading, <i>e.g.</i> from the crannog to 
the shore of the Ashgrove loch, &ldquo;a causeway of rough blocks
of sandstone slabs.&rdquo; <a name="citation47b"></a><a 
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; If one stone
crannog had a stone causeway, why should this ancient inhabited 
cairn or round tower not possess a stone causeway?&nbsp; Though 
useless at high water, at low water it would afford better 
going.&nbsp; In a note to <i>Ivanhoe</i>, and in his Northern 
tour of 1814, Scott describes a stone causeway to a broch on an 
artificial island <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in Loch Cleik-him-in, near 
Lerwick.&nbsp; Now this loch, says Scott, was, at the time when 
the broch was inhabited, open to the flow of tide water.</p>
<p>As people certainly did live on these structures of Langbank 
and Dunbuie during the broch and crannog age (centuries 5-12) it 
really matters not to our purpose <i>why</i> they did so, or 
<i>how</i> they did so.&nbsp; Let us suppose that the circular 
wall of the stone superstructure slanted inwards, as is not 
unusual.&nbsp; In that case the habitable area at the top may be 
reduced to any extent that is thought probable, with this 
limitation:&mdash;the habitable space must not be too small for 
the accommodation of the persons who filled up the eastern third 
of an area of from twelve to fourteen feet in breadth, and in 
some places a foot in thickness, with a veritable kitchen-midden,
of &ldquo;broken and partially burned bones of various animals, 
shells of edible molluscs, and a quantity of ashes and charcoal .

<p>But Dr. Munro assures me that the remains discovered could be 
deposited in a few years of regular occupancy by two or three 
persons.</p>
<p>The structure certainly yielded habitable space enough to 
accommodate the persons who, in the fifth to twelfth centuries, 
left these traces of their <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>occupancy.&nbsp; Beyond that fact I do not pretend to 
estimate the habitable area.</p>
<p>Why did these people live on this structure in the fifth to 
twelfth centuries?&nbsp; Almost certainly, not for the purpose of
directing the navigation of the Clyde.&nbsp; At that early date, 
which I think we may throw far back in the space of the six 
centuries of the estimate, or may even throw further back still, 
the Clyde was mainly navigated by canoes of two feet or so in 
depth, though we ought to have statistics of remains of larger 
vessels discovered in the river bed. <a name="citation49a"></a><a
href="#footnote49a" class="citation">[49a]</a>&nbsp; I think we 
may say that the finances of Glasgow, in St. Kentigern&rsquo;s 
day, about 570-600 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, would not be 
applied to the construction of Dr. Munro&rsquo;s &ldquo;tower 
with its central pole and very thick walls&rdquo; <a 
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b" 
class="citation">[49b]</a> erected merely for the purpose of 
warning canoes off shoals in the Clyde.</p>
<p>That the purpose of the erection was to direct the navigation 
of Clyde by canoes, or by the long vessels of the Viking raiders,
appears to me improbable.&nbsp; I offer, <i>periculo meo</i>, a 
different conjecture, <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of which I shall show reason to 
believe that Dr. Munro may not disapprove.</p>
<p>The number of the dwellers in the structure, and the duration 
of their occupancy, does not affect my argument.&nbsp; If two 
natives, in a very few years, could deposit the &ldquo;veritable 
kitchen midden,&rdquo; with all the sawn horns, bone implements, 
and other undisputed relics, we must suppose that the term of 
occupancy was very brief, or not continuous, and that the stone 
structure &ldquo;with very thick walls like the brochs&rdquo; 
represented labours which were utilised for a few years, or 
seldom.&nbsp; My doubt is as to whether the structure was 
intended for the benefit of navigators of the Clyde&mdash;in 
shallow canoes!</p>
<h2><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>IX&mdash;A GUESS AT THE POSSIBLE PURPOSE OF LANGBANK AND
DUMBUCK</h2>
<p>The Dumbuck structure, when occupied, adjoined and commanded a
<i>ford</i> across the undeepened Clyde of uncommercial 
times.&nbsp; So Sir Arthur Mitchell informs us. <a 
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a" 
class="citation">[51a]</a>&nbsp; The Langbank structure, as I 
understand, is opposite to that of Dumbuck on the southern side 
of the river.&nbsp; If two strongly built structures large enough
for occupation exist on opposite sides of a ford, their purpose 
is evident: they guard the ford, like the two stone camps on each
side of the narrows of the Avon at Clifton.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro, on the other hand, says, &ldquo;the smallness of 
the habitable area on both &ldquo;sites&rdquo; puts them out of 
the category of military forts.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b" 
class="citation">[51b]</a>&nbsp; My suggestion is that the 
structure was so far &ldquo;military&rdquo; as is implied in its 
being occupied, <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>with Langbank on the opposite bank of
Clyde by keepers of the ford.&nbsp; In 1901 Dr. Munro wrote, 
&ldquo;even the keepers of the watch-tower at the ford of Dumbuck
had their quern, and ground their own corn.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a" 
class="citation">[52a]</a>&nbsp; This idea has therefore passed 
through Dr. Munro&rsquo;s mind, though I did not know the fact 
till after I had come to the same hypothesis.&nbsp; The habitable
area was therefore, adequate to the wants of these festive 
people.&nbsp; I conjecture that these &ldquo;keepers of the 
watch-tower at the ford&rdquo; were military &ldquo;watchers of 
the ford,&rdquo; for that seems to me less improbable than that 
&ldquo;a round tower with very thick walls, <a 
name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b" 
class="citation">[52b]</a> like the brochs and other forts of 
North Britain,&rdquo; was built in the interests of the 
navigation of Clyde at a very remote period. <a 
name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c" 
class="citation">[52c]</a></p>
<p>But really all this is of no importance to the argument.&nbsp;
People lived in these sites, perhaps as early as 400 <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span> or earlier.&nbsp; Such places of safety
were sadly needed during the intermittent and turbulent Roman 
occupation.</p>
<h2><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>X&mdash;THE LAST DAY AT OLD DUMBUCK</h2>
<p>Suppose the sites were occupied by the watchers of the 
ford.&nbsp; There they lived, no man knows how long, on their 
perch over the waters of Clyde.&nbsp; They dwelt at top of a 
stone structure some eight feet above low water mark, for they 
could not live on the ground floor, of which the walls, fifty 
feet thick at the base, defied the waves of the high tides driven
by the west wind.</p>
<p>There our friends lived, and probably tatooed themselves, and 
slew <i>Bos Longifrons</i> and the deer that, in later ages, 
would have been forbidden game to them.&nbsp; If I may trust 
Bede, born in 672, and finishing his History in 731, our friends 
were Picts, and spoke a now unknown language, <i>not</i> that of 
the Bretonnes, or Cymri, or Welsh, who lived on the northern side
of the Firth of Clyde.&nbsp; Or the occupants of Dumbuck, on the 
north side of the river, were Cymri; those of Langbank, on the 
south side, were Picts.&nbsp; I may at once <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>say that I 
decline to be responsible for Bede, and his ethnology, but he 
lived nearer to those days than we do.</p>
<p>With their ladder of fifteen feet long, a slab of oak, split 
from the tree by wedges, and having six holes chopped out of the 
solid for steps, they climbed to their perch, the first floor of 
their abode.&nbsp; I never heard of a ladder made in this way, 
but the Zu&ntilde;is used simply to cut notches for the feet in 
the trunk of a tree, and &ldquo;sich a getting up stairs&rdquo; 
it must have been, when there was rain, and the notches were 
wet!</p>
<p>Time passed, the kitchen midden grew, and the Cymri founded 
Ailcluith, &ldquo;Clyde rock,&rdquo; now Dumbarton; &ldquo;to 
this day,&rdquo; says Bede, &ldquo;the strongest city of the 
Britons.&rdquo; <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54" 
class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; Then the Scots came, and turned 
the Britons out; and St. Columba came, and St. Kentigern from 
Wales (573-574), and began to spread the Gospel among the pagan 
Picts and Cymri.&nbsp; Stone amulets and stone idols, (if the 
disputed objects are idols and amulets,) &ldquo;have had their 
day,&rdquo; (as Bob Acres says &ldquo;Damns have had their 
day,&rdquo;) and, with Ailcluith in Scots&rsquo; hands, 
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas time for us to go&rdquo; thought the Picts and
Cymri of Langbank and Dumbuck.</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>Sadly they evacuate their old towers or cairns before 
the Scots who now command the Dumbuck ford from Dumbarton.&nbsp; 
They cross to land on their stone causeway at low water.&nbsp; 
They abandon the old canoe in the little dock where it was found 
by Mr. Bruce.&nbsp; They throw down the venerable ladder.&nbsp; 
They leave behind only the canoe, the deer horns, 
stone-polishers, sharpened bones, the lower stone of a quern, and
the now obsolete, or purely folk-loreish stone 
&ldquo;amulets,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pendants,&rdquo; and the 
figurines, which to call &ldquo;idols&rdquo; is unscientific, 
while to call them &ldquo;totems&rdquo; is to display 
&ldquo;facetious and rejoicing ignorance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Munro 
merely quotes this foolish use of the term totem by others.</p>
<p>These old things the evicted Picts and Cymri abandoned, while 
they carried with them their more valuable property, their Early 
Iron axes and knives, their treasured bits of red &ldquo;Samian 
ware,&rdquo; inherited from Roman times, their amber beads, and 
the rest of their bibelots, down to the minutest fragment of 
pottery.</p>
<p>Or it may not have been so: the conquering Scots may have 
looted the cairns, and borne the Pictish cairn-dwellers into 
captivity.</p>
<p>Looking at any broch, or hill fort, or crannog, the fancy 
dwells on the last day of its occupation: the day when the canoe 
was left to subside into <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the mud and 
decaying vegetable matter of the loch.&nbsp; In changed times, in
new conditions, the inhabitants move away to houses less damp, 
and better equipped with more modern appliances.&nbsp; I see the 
little troop, or perhaps only two natives, cross the causeway, 
while the Minstrel sings in Pictish or Welsh a version of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Auld Hoose, the Auld Hoose,<br />
What though the rooms were sma&rsquo;,<br />
Wi&rsquo; six feet o&rsquo; diameter,<br />
And a rung gaun through the ha&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tears come to my eyes, as I think of the Last Day of Old 
Dumbuck, for, take it as you will, there <i>was</i> a last day of
Dumbuck, as of windy Ilios, and of &ldquo;Carthage left deserted 
of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ends my little idyllic interlude, and, if I am wrong, blame
Venerable Bede!</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>XI&mdash;MY THEORY OF PROVISIONAL DATE</h2>
<p>Provisionally, and for the sake of argument merely, may I 
suggest that the occupancy of these sites may be dated by me, 
about 300-550 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>?&nbsp; That date is
well within the Iron Age: iron had long been known and used in 
North Britain.&nbsp; But to the non-archaeological reader, the 
terms Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, are apt to prove 
misleading.&nbsp; The early Iron Age, like the Bronze Age, was 
familiar with the use of implements of stone.&nbsp; In the 
Scottish crannogs, admirably described by Dr. Munro, in his 
<i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>, were found implements of 
flint, a polished stone axe-head, an iron knife at the same 
lowest level, finger rings of gold, a forged English coin of the 
sixth or seventh century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, 
well-equipped canoes (a common attendant of crannogs), the 
greater part of a stone inscribed with concentric circles, a 
cupped stone, and a large quartz crystal of the kind which 
Apaches in North <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>America, and the Euahlayi tribe in 
New South Wales, use in crystal gazing.&nbsp; In early ages, 
after the metals had been worked, stone, bronze, and iron were 
still used as occasion served, just as the Australian black will 
now fashion an implement in &ldquo;palaeolithic&rdquo; wise, with
a few chips; now will polish a weapon in &ldquo;neolithic&rdquo; 
fashion; and, again, will chip a fragment of glass with wonderful
delicacy; or will put as good an edge as he can on a piece of 
hoop iron.</p>
<p>I venture, then, merely for the sake of argument, to date the 
origin of the Clyde sites in the dark years of unrecorded turmoil
which preceded and followed the Roman withdrawal.&nbsp; The least
unpractical way of getting nearer to their purpose is the careful
excavation of a structure of wood and stone near Eriska, where 
Prince Charles landed in 1745.&nbsp; Dr. Munro has seen and 
described this site, but is unable to explain it.&nbsp; Certainly
it cannot be a Corporation cairn.</p>
<h2><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>XII&mdash;THE DISPUTED OBJECTS</h2>
<p>We now approach the disputed and very puzzling objects found 
in the three Clyde sites.&nbsp; My object is, not to demonstrate 
that they were actually fashioned in, say, 410-550 <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span>, or that they were relics of an age far
more remote, but merely to re-state the argument of Dr. Joseph 
Anderson, Keeper of the Scottish National Museum, and of Sir 
Arthur Mitchell, both of them most widely experienced and 
sagacious archaeologists.&nbsp; They play the waiting game, and 
it may be said that they &ldquo;sit upon the fence&rdquo;; I am 
proud to occupy a railing in their company.&nbsp; Dr. Anderson 
spoke at a meeting of the Scots Society of Antiquaries, May 14, 
1900, when Mr. Bruce read a paper on Dumbuck, and exhibited the 
finds.&nbsp; &ldquo;With regard to the relics, he said that there
was nothing exceptional in the chronological <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>horizon of a 
portion of them from both sites (Dumbuck and Dunbuie), but as 
regards another portion, he could find no place for it in any 
archaeological series, as it had &lsquo;no recognisable affinity 
with any objects found anywhere else.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Dr. Anderson, (and he has not 
altered his mind,) &ldquo;I do not consider it possible or 
necessary in the meantime that there should be a final 
pronouncement on these questions.&nbsp; In the absence of 
decisive evidence, which time may supply, I prefer to suspend my 
judgment&mdash;merely placing the suspected objects (as they 
place themselves) in the list of things that must wait for 
further evidence, because they contradict present 
experience.&nbsp; It has often happened that new varieties of 
things have been regarded with suspicion on account of their lack
of correspondence with things previously known, and that the 
lapse of time has brought corroboration of their genuineness 
through fresh discoveries.&nbsp; If time brings no such 
corroboration, they still remain in their proper classification 
as things whose special character has not been confirmed by 
archaeological experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Mitchell spoke in the same sense, advising 
suspension of judgment, and that we should await the results of 
fresh explorations both <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>at Dumbuck and elsewhere. <a 
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61" 
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Murray said that the disputed
finds &ldquo;are puzzling, but we need not condemn them because 
we do not understand them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Munro will not 
suspend <i>his</i> judgment: the objects, he declares, are 
spurious.</p>
<h2><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>XIII&mdash;METHOD OF INQUIRY</h2>
<p>I remarked, early in this tract, that &ldquo;with due 
deference, and with doubt, I think Dr. Munro&rsquo;s methods 
capable of modification.&rdquo;&nbsp; I meant that I prefer, 
unlike Dr. Munro in this case, to extend the archaeological gaze 
beyond the limits of things already known to occur in the 
Scottish area which&mdash;by the way&mdash;must contain many 
relics still unknown.&nbsp; I</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let Observation with extensive view<br />
Survey mankind from China to Peru,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to discover whether objects analogous to those under dispute 
occur anywhere among early races of the past or present.&nbsp; 
This kind of wide comparison is the method of Anthropology.&nbsp;
Thus Prof. Rhys and others find so very archaic an institution as
the reckoning of descent in the female line,&mdash;inheritance 
going through the Mother,&mdash;among the Picts of Scotland, and 
they even find traces of totemism, an institution already outworn
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>among several of the naked tribes of Australia, who 
reckon descent in the male line.</p>
<p>Races do not, in fact, advance on a straight and unbroken 
highway of progress.&nbsp; You find that the Kurnai of Australia 
are more civilised, as regards the evolution of the modern 
Family, than were the Picts who built crannogs and dug canoes, 
and cultivated the soil, and had domesticated animals, and used 
iron, all of them things that the Kurnai never dreamed of 
doing.</p>
<p>As to traces of Totemism in Scotland and Ireland, I am not 
persuaded by Professor Rhys that they occur, and are attested by 
Celtic legends about the connection of men and kinships with 
animals, and by personal and kinship names derived from 
animals.&nbsp; The question is very obscure. <a 
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63" 
class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; But as the topic of Totemism has 
been introduced, I may say that many of the mysterious archaic 
markings on rocks, and decorations of implements, in other 
countries, are certainly known to be a kind of shorthand design 
of the totem animal.&nbsp; Thus a circle, whence proceeds a line 
ending in a triple fork, represents the raven totem in North 
America: another design, to our eyes meaningless, stands for the 
wolf totem; a <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>third design, a set of bands on a 
spear shaft, does duty for the gerfalcon totem, and so on. <a 
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a" 
class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp; Equivalent marks, such as 
spirals, and tracks of emu&rsquo;s feet, occur on sacred stones 
found round the graves of Australian blacks on the Darling 
River.&nbsp; They were associated with rites which the oldest 
blacks decline to explain.&nbsp; The markings are understood to 
be totemic.&nbsp; Occasionally they are linear, as in Ogam 
writing. <a name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b" 
class="citation">[64b]</a></p>
<p>Any one who is interested in the subject of the origin, in 
certain places, of the patterns, may turn to Mr. Haddon&rsquo;s 
<i>Evolution of Art</i>. <a name="citation64c"></a><a 
href="#footnote64c" class="citation">[64c]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Haddon 
shows how the Portuguese pattern of horizontal triangles is, in 
the art of the uncivilised natives of Brazil, meant to represent 
bats. <a name="citation64d"></a><a href="#footnote64d" 
class="citation">[64d]</a>&nbsp; A cross, dotted, within a 
circle, is directly derived, through several stages, from a 
representation of an alligator. <a name="citation64e"></a><a 
href="#footnote64e" class="citation">[64e]</a></p>
<p>We cannot say whether or not the same pattern, found at 
Dumbuck, in Central Australia, and in tropical America, arose in 
the &ldquo;schematising&rdquo; of the same object in nature, in 
all three regions, or not.&nbsp; Without direct evidence, we 
cannot assign a meaning to the patterns.</p>
<h2><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>XIV&mdash;THE POSSIBLE MEANINGS OF THE MARKS AND 
OBJECTS</h2>
<p>My private opinion as to the meaning of the archaic marks and 
the Clyde objects which bear them, has, in part by my own fault, 
been misunderstood by Dr. Munro.&nbsp; He bases an argument on 
the idea that I suppose the disputed &ldquo;pendants&rdquo; to 
have had, in Clydesdale, precisely the same legendary, customary,
and magical significance as the stone churinga of the Arunta 
tribe in Australia.&nbsp; That is not my theory.&nbsp; Dr. Munro 
quotes me, without indicating the source, (which, I learn, is my 
first letter on the subject to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>, Jan. 
10th, 1899), as saying that the Clyde objects &ldquo;are in 
absolutely startling agreement&rdquo; with the Arunta 
<i>churinga</i>. <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65" 
class="citation">[65]</a></p>
<p>Doubtless, before I saw the objects, I thus overstated my 
case, in a letter to a newspaper, in 1899.&nbsp; <!-- page 
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>But 
in my essay originally published in the <i>Contemporary 
Review</i>, (March 1899,) and reprinted in my book, <i>Magic and 
Religion</i>, of 1901, <a name="citation66"></a><a 
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a> I stated my real 
opinion.&nbsp; This is a maturely considered account of my views 
as they were in 1899-1901, and, unlike old newspaper 
correspondence, is easily accessible to the student.&nbsp; It is 
<i>not</i> &ldquo;out of print.&rdquo;&nbsp; I compared the 
Australian marks on small stones and on rock walls, and other 
&ldquo;fixtures in the landscape,&rdquo; with the markings on 
Scottish boulders, rock walls, cists, and so forth, and also with
the marks on the disputed objects.&nbsp; I added &ldquo;the 
startling analogy between Australia and old Scottish markings 
<i>saute aux yeux</i>,&rdquo; and I spoke truth.&nbsp; Down to 
the designs which represent footmarks, the analogy is 
&ldquo;startling,&rdquo; is of great interest, and was never 
before made the subject of comment.</p>
<p>I said that we could not know whether or not the markings, in 
Scotland and Australia, had the same meaning.</p>
<p>As to my opinion, then, namely that we cannot say what is the 
significance of an archaic pattern in Scotland, or elsewhere, 
though we may know the meaning assigned to it in Central 
Australia, there can no longer be any mistake.&nbsp; I take the 
blame of having misled Dr. Munro by an unguarded <!-- page 
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>expression in a letter to the Society of Scottish 
Antiquaries, <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67" 
class="citation">[67]</a> saying that, if the disputed objects 
were genuine, they implied the survival, on Clyde, &ldquo;of a 
singularly archaic set of ritual and magical ideas,&rdquo; namely
those peculiar to the Arunta and Kaitish tribes of Central 
Australia.&nbsp; But that was a slip of the pen, merely.</p>
<p>This being the case, I need not reply to arguments of Dr. 
Munro (pp. 248-250) against an hypothesis which no instructed 
person could entertain, beginning with the assumption that from 
an unknown centre, some people who held Arunta ideas migrated to 
Central Australia, and others to the Clyde.&nbsp; Nobody supposes
that the use of identical or similar patterns, and of stones of 
superstitious purpose, implies community of race.&nbsp; These 
things may anywhere be independently evolved, and in different 
regions may have quite different meanings, if any; while the use 
of &ldquo;charm stones&rdquo; or witch stones, is common among 
savages, and survives, in England and Scotland, to this 
day.&nbsp; The reader will understand that I am merely applying 
Mr. E. B. Tylor&rsquo;s method of the study of &ldquo;survivals 
in culture,&rdquo; which all anthropologists have used since the 
publication of Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, 
thirty-five years ago.</p>
<h2><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>XV&mdash;QUESTION OF METHOD CONTINUED</h2>
<p>What is admitted to be true of survivals in the Family among 
the Picts may also be true as to other survivals in art, 
superstition, and so forth.&nbsp; I would, therefore, compare the
disputed Clyde objects with others analogous to them, of known or
unknown purpose, wheresoever they may be found.&nbsp; I am 
encouraged in this course by observing that it is pursued, for 
example, by the eminent French archaeologist, Monsieur 
Cartailhac, in his book <i>Les Ages Pr&eacute;historiques de 
France et d&rsquo;Espagne</i>.&nbsp; He does not hesitate, as we 
shall see, to compare peculiar objects found in France or Spain, 
with analogous objects of doubtful purpose, found in America or 
the Antilles.&nbsp; M. Cartailhac writes that, to find anything 
resembling certain Portuguese &ldquo;thin plaques of slate in the
form of a crook, or crozier,&rdquo; he &ldquo;sought through all 
ethnographic material, ancient and modern.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did 
find the parallels to his Portuguese objects, one <!-- page 
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>from 
Gaudeloup, the other either French, or from the Antilles. <a 
name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69" 
class="citation">[69]</a></p>
<p>Sir John Evans, again, compares British with Australian 
objects; in fact the practice is recognised.&nbsp; I therefore 
intend to make use of this comparative method.&nbsp; On the other
hand, Dr. Munro denies that any of my analogies drawn from remote
regions are analogous, and it will be necessary to try to prove 
that they are,&mdash;that my Australian, American, Portuguese, 
and other objects are of the same kind, apparently, as some of 
the disputed relics of the Clyde.</p>
<p>If I succeed, one point will be made probable.&nbsp; Either 
the Clyde objects are old, or the modern maker knew much more of 
archaeology than many of his critics and used his knowledge to 
direct his manufacture of spurious things; or he kept coinciding 
<i>accidentally</i> with genuine relics of which he knew 
nothing.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>XVI&mdash;MAGIC</h2>
<p>Again, I must push my method beyond that of Dr. Munro, by 
considering the subject of Magic, in relation to perforated and 
other stones, whether inscribed with designs, or 
uninscribed.&nbsp; Among the disputed objects are many such 
stones, and it is legitimate for me to prove, not only that they 
occur in many sites of ancient life, but that their magical uses 
are still recognised, or were very recently recognised in the 
British Folk-lore of to-day.</p>
<p>A superstition which has certainly endured to the nineteenth 
century may obviously have existed among the Picts, or whoever 
they were, of the crannog and broch period on Clyde.&nbsp; The 
only <i>a priori</i> objection is the absence of such objects 
among finds made on British soil, but our discoveries cannot be 
exhaustive: time may reveal other examples, and already we have a
few examples, apart from the objects in dispute.</p>
<h2><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>XVII&mdash;DISPUTED OBJECTS CLASSIFIED</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro classifies the disputed objects as <i>Weapons</i>, 
<i>Implements</i>, &ldquo;<i>Amulets</i>&rdquo; <i>or 
Pendants</i>, <i>Cup-and-Ring Stones</i>, &ldquo;<i>Human 
Figurines or Idols</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reasons of convenience, and because what I heard about 
group 3, the &ldquo;amulets or pendants&rdquo; first led me into 
this discussion, I shall here first examine them.&nbsp; Dr. Munro
reproduces some of them in one plate (xv. p. 228).&nbsp; He does 
not say by what process they are reproduced; merely naming them .
. . &ldquo;objects of slate and stone from Dumbuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Munro describes the &ldquo;amulets&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;pendants&rdquo; thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The largest group of objects (plate <span 
class="smcap">xv.</span>) consists of the so-called amulets or 
pendants of stone, shale, and shell, some fifteen to twenty 
specimens of which have been preserved and recorded as having 
been found on the different stations, viz., three from Dunbuie 
(exclusive of a few perforated oyster shells), eleven from 
Dumbuck, and one from Langbank.&nbsp; Their ornamentation is 
chiefly of the cup-and-ring order, only a few <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>having 
patterns composed of straight lines.&nbsp; Some of them are so 
large as to be unfit to be used as amulets or pendants, such, for
example, as that represented by no. 14, which is 9 inches long, 
3&frac12; inches broad, and &frac12; inch thick.&nbsp; The 
ornamentation consists of a strongly incised line running 
downwards from the perforation with small branch lines directed 
alternately right and left.&nbsp; Any human being, who would wear
this object, either as an ornament or religious emblem, would be 
endowed with the most archaic ideas of decorative art known in 
the history of human civilisation.&nbsp; Yet we can have no doubt
that the individual who manufactured it, if he were an inhabitant
of any of the Clyde sites, was at the same time living in a 
period not devoid of culture, and was in possession of excellent 
cutting implements, most likely of iron, with which he 
manipulated wood, deer-horn, and other substances.&nbsp; These 
objects are nearly all perforated, as if intended for suspension,
but sometimes, in addition to this, there is a large central hole
around which there is always an ornamentation, generally 
consisting of incised circles or semicircles, with divergent 
lines leading into small hollow points, the so-called 
cup-marks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shall return to the theory that the stones were 
&ldquo;ornaments&rdquo;; meanwhile I proceed to the consideration
of &ldquo;cup-marks&rdquo; on stones, large or small.</p>
<h2><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>XVIII&mdash;CUP MARKS IN CRANNOGS</h2>
<p>As to cup marks, or <i>cupules</i>, little basins styled also 
<i>&eacute;cuelles</i>, now isolated, now grouped, now separate, 
now joined by hollowed lines, they are familiar on rocks, funeral
cists, and so forth in Asia, Europe, and North America (and 
Australia), as M. Cartailhac remarks in reviewing Dr. 
Magni&rsquo;s work on Cupped Rocks near Como. <a 
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a" 
class="citation">[73a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Their meaning escapes 
us,&rdquo; says M. Cartailhac.</p>
<p>These cups, or cupules, or <i>&eacute;cuelles</i> occur, not 
only at Dumbuck, but in association with a Scottish crannog of 
the Iron age, admirably described by Dr. Munro himself. <a 
name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b" 
class="citation">[73b]</a>&nbsp; He found a polished celt, <a 
name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c" 
class="citation">[73c]</a> and a cupped stone, and he found a 
fragmentary block of red sandstone, about a foot in length, 
inscribed with concentric circles, surrounding a cup.&nbsp; The 
remainder of the stone, with the smaller part of the design, was 
not found.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Here, then, we have these archaic patterns and marks on 
isolated stones, one of them about 13 inches long, in a genuine 
Scottish crannog, of the genuine Iron age, while flint celts also
occur, and objects of bronze.&nbsp; Therefore cup markings, and 
other archaic markings are not unknown or suspicious things in a 
genuine pile structure in Scotland.&nbsp; Why, then, suspect them
at Dumbuck?&nbsp; At Dumbuck the cups occur on a triangular block
of sandstone, 14&frac12; inches long and 4 inches thick.&nbsp; 
Another cupped block is of 21&frac12; inches by 16&frac12;. <a 
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74" 
class="citation">[74]</a></p>
<p>No forger brought these cupped stones in his waistcoat 
pocket.</p>
<p>We have thus made good the point that an isolated cupped 
stone, and an isolated stone inscribed with concentric circles 
round a cup, do occur in a crannog containing objects of the 
stone, bronze, and iron ages.&nbsp; The meaning, if any, of these
inscribed stones, in the Lochlee crannog, is unknown.&nbsp; Many 
of the disputed objects vary from them in size, while presenting 
examples of archaic patterns.&nbsp; Are they to be rejected 
because they vary in size?</p>
<p>We see that the making of this class of decorative patterns, 
whether they originally had a recognised meaning; or whether, 
beginning as mere <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>decorations, perhaps 
&ldquo;schematistic&rdquo; designs of real objects, they later 
had an arbitrary symbolic sense imposed upon them, is familiar to
Australians of to-day, who use, indifferently, stone implements 
of the neolithic or of the palaeolithic type.&nbsp; We also know 
that &ldquo;in a remote corner of tropical America,&rdquo; the 
rocks are inscribed with patterns &ldquo;typically identical with
those engraved in the British rocks.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75" 
class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; These markings are in the country
of the Chiriquis, an extinct gold-working neolithic people, very 
considerable artists, especially in the making of painted 
ceramics.&nbsp; The Picts and Scots have left nothing at all 
approaching to their pottery work.</p>
<p>These identical patterns, therefore, have been independently 
evolved in places most remote in space and in stage of 
civilisation, while in Galloway, as I shall show, I have seen 
some of them scrawled in chalk on the flag stones in front of 
cottage doors.&nbsp; The identity of many Scottish and Australian
patterns is undenied, while I disclaim the opinion that, in each 
region, they had the same significance.</p>
<p>I have now established the coincidence between the markings of
rocks in Australia, in tropical America, and in Scotland.&nbsp; I
have shown that <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>such markings occur, in Scotland, 
associated with remains, in a crannog, of the Age of Iron.&nbsp; 
They also occur on stones, large (cupped) and small, in 
Dumbuck.&nbsp; My next business is, if I can, to establish, what 
Dr. Munro denies, a parallelism between these disputed Clyde 
stones, and the larger or smaller inscribed stones of the Arunta 
and Kaitish, in Australia, and other small stones, decorated or 
plain, found in many ancient European sites.&nbsp; Their meaning 
we know not, but probably they were either reckoned ornamental, 
or magical, or both.</p>
<h2><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>XIX&mdash;PARALLELISM BETWEEN THE DISPUTED OBJECTS AND 
OTHER OBJECTS ELSEWHERE</h2>
<p>On Clyde (if the disputed things be genuine) we find decorated
plaques or slabs of soft stone, of very various dimensions and 
shapes.&nbsp; In Australia some of these objects are round, many 
oval, others elongated, others thin and pointed, like a pencil; 
others oblong&mdash;while on Clyde, some are round, one is 
coffin-shaped, others are palette-shaped, others are pear-shaped 
(the oval tapering to one extremity), one is triangular, one is 
oblong. <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77" 
class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; In Australia, as on Clyde, the 
stones bear some of the archaic markings common on the rock faces
both in Scotland and in Central Australia: on large rocks they 
are <i>painted</i>, in Australia, in Scotland they are 
<i>incised</i>.&nbsp; I maintain that there is a singularly 
strong analogy between the two sets of circumstances, Scottish 
and Australian; large rocks <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>inscribed 
with archaic designs; smaller stones inscribed with some of these
designs.&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp; Dr. Munro, on the other hand, 
asserts that there is no such parallelism.</p>
<p>But I must point out that there is, to some extent, an 
admitted parallelism.&nbsp; &ldquo;The familiar designs which 
served as models to the Clyde artists&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;plain 
cups and rings, with or without gutter channels, spirals, 
circles, concentric circles, semicircles, horseshoe and 
harp-shaped figures, etc.,&rdquo; occur, or a selection of them 
occurs, both on the disputed objects, and on the rocks of the 
hills.&nbsp; So Dr. Munro truly says (p. 260).</p>
<p>The same marks, plain cups, cups and rings, spirals, 
concentric circles, horseshoes, medial lines with short slanting 
lines proceeding from them, like the branches on a larch, or the 
spine of a fish, occur on the rocks of the Arunta hills, and also
on plaques of stone cherished and called churinga 
(&ldquo;sacred&rdquo;) by the Arunta. <a name="citation78"></a><a
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; Here is what I
call &ldquo;parallelism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Munro denies this parallelism.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, other parallelisms with markings other than
those of the rocks at Auchentorlie which Dr. Munro regards as the
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>sources of the faker&rsquo;s inspiration.&nbsp; Thus, on
objects from Dumbuck (Munro, plate <span class="smcap">xv.</span>
figs, 11 and 12), there are two &ldquo;signs&rdquo;: one is a 
straight line, horizontal, with three shorter lines under it at 
right angles, the other a line with four lines under it.&nbsp; 
These signs &ldquo;are very frequent in Trojan 
antiquities,&rdquo; and on almost all the &ldquo;hut urns&rdquo; 
found &ldquo;below the lava at Marino, near Albano, or on ancient
tombs near Corneto.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever they mean, (and Prof. 
Sayce finds the former of the two &ldquo;signs&rdquo; &ldquo;as a
Hittite hieroglyph,&rdquo;) I do not know them at 
Auchentorlie.&nbsp; After &ldquo;a scamper among the surrounding 
hills,&rdquo; the faker may have passed an evening with Dr. 
Schliemann&rsquo;s <i>Troja</i> (1884, pp. 126, 127) and may have
taken a hint from the passages which have just been cited.&nbsp; 
Or he may have cribbed the idea of these archaic markings from 
Don Manuel de G&oacute;ngora y Martinez, his <i>Antig&uuml;edades
Pre-hist&oacute;ricas de Andaluc&iacute;a</i> (Madrid, 1868, p. 
65, figures 70, 71).&nbsp; In these Spanish examples the marks 
are, clearly, &ldquo;schematised&rdquo; or rudimentary designs of
animals, in origin.&nbsp; Our faker is a man of reading.&nbsp; 
But, <i>enfin</i>, the world is full of just such markings, which
may have had one meaning here, another there, or may have been 
purely decorative.&nbsp; &ldquo;Race&rdquo; has nothing to do 
with the markings.&nbsp; They are &ldquo;universally <!-- page 
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>human,&rdquo; though, in some cases, they may have been 
transmitted by one to another people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p80ab.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 5" src="images/p80as.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The reader must decide as to whether I have proved my 
parallelisms, denied by Dr. Munro, between the Clyde, Australian,
and other markings, whether on rocks or on smaller stones. <a

<p>It suffices me to have tried to prove the parallelism between

denial thereof&mdash;&ldquo;I unhesitatingly maintain that there 
is no parallelism whatever between the two sets of 
objects.&rdquo; <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"

81</span>XX&mdash;UNMARKED CHARM STONES</h2>
<p>It must be kept in mind that churinga, &ldquo;witch 
stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;charm stones,&rdquo; or whatever the 
smaller stones may be styled, are not necessarily marked with any
pattern.&nbsp; In Australia, in Portugal, in Russia, in France, 
in North America, in Scotland, as we shall see, such stones may 
be unmarked, may bear no inscription or pattern. <a 
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81" 
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; These are plain magic stones, 
such as survive in English peasant superstition.</p>
<p>In Dr. Munro&rsquo;s <i>Ancient Lake Dwellings of Europe</i>, 
plain stone discs, perforated, do occur, but rarely, and there 
are few examples of pendants with cupped marks.&nbsp; Of these 
two, as being cupped pendants, might look like analogues of the 
disputed Clyde stones, but Dr. Munro, owing to the subsequent 
exposure of the &ldquo;Horn Age&rdquo; <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>forgeries, 
now has &ldquo;a strong suspicion that he was taken in&rdquo; by 
the things. <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a" 
class="citation">[82a]</a></p>
<p>To return to Scottish stones.</p>
<p>In Mr. Graham Callander&rsquo;s essay on perforated stones, <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b" 
class="citation">[82b]</a> he publishes an uninscribed triangular
stone, with a perforation, apparently for suspension.&nbsp; This 
is one of several such Scottish stones, and though we cannot 
prove it, may have had a superstitious purpose.&nbsp; Happily Sir
Walter Scott discovered and describes the magical use to which 
this kind of charm stone was put in 1814.&nbsp; When a person was
unwell, in the Orkney Isles, the people, like many savages, 
supposed that a wizard had stolen his heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
parties&rsquo; friends resort to a cunning man or woman, who 
hangs about the [patient&rsquo;s] neck a triangular stone in the 
shape of a heart.&rdquo; <a name="citation82c"></a><a 
href="#footnote82c" class="citation">[82c]</a>&nbsp; This is a 
thoroughly well-known savage superstition, the stealing of the 
heart, or vital spirit, and its restoration by magic.</p>
<p>This use of triangular or heart-shaped perforated stones was 
not inconsistent with the civilisation of the nineteenth century,
and, of course, was not inconsistent with the civilisation <!-- 
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>of the Picts.&nbsp; A stone may have magical purpose, 
though it bears no markings.&nbsp; Meanwhile most churinga, and 
many of the disputed objects, have archaic markings, which also 
occur on rock faces.</p>
<h2><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>XXI&mdash;QUALITY OF ART ON THE STONES</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro next reproduces two <i>wooden</i> churinga 
(<i>churinga irula</i>), as being very unlike the Clydesdale 
objects <i>in stone</i> <a name="citation84a"></a><a 
href="#footnote84a" class="citation">[84a]</a> (figures 5, 
6).&nbsp; They are: but I was speaking of Australian <i>churinga 
nanja</i>, of <i>stone</i>.&nbsp; A stone churinga <a 
name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b" 
class="citation">[84b]</a> presented, I think, by Mr. Spencer 
through me to the Scottish Society of Antiquaries (also 
reproduced by Dr. Munro), is a much better piece of work, as I 
saw when it reached me, than most of the Clyde things.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The Clyde amulets are,&rdquo; says Dr. Munro, 
&ldquo;neither strictly oval,&rdquo; (<i>nor are very many 
Australian samples</i>,) &ldquo;nor well finished, nor 
symmetrical, being generally water-worn fragments of shale or 
clay slate. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; They thus resemble ancient Red 
Indian pendants.</p>
<p>As to the art of the patterns, the Australians have a 
considerable artistic gift; as Grosse <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>remarks, <a 
name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a" 
class="citation">[85a]</a> while either the Clyde folk had less, 
or the modern artists had <i>not</i> &ldquo;some practical 
artistic skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Dr. Munro has said that any one 
with &ldquo;some practical artistic skill&rdquo; could whittle 
the Clyde objects. <a name="citation85b"></a><a 
href="#footnote85b" class="citation">[85b]</a>&nbsp; He also 
thinks that in one case they &ldquo;disclose the hand of one not 
altogether ignorant of art&rdquo; (p. 231).</p>
<p>Let me put a crucial question.&nbsp; Are the archaic markings 
on the disputed objects better, or worse, or much on a level with
the general run of such undisputably ancient markings on large 
rocks, cists, and cairns in Scotland?&nbsp; I think the art in 
both cases is on the same low level.&nbsp; When the art on the 
disputed objects is more formal and precise, as on some shivered 
stones at Dunbuie, &ldquo;the stiffness of the lines and figures 
reminds one more of rule and compass than of the free-hand work 
of prehistoric artists.&rdquo; <a name="citation85c"></a><a 
href="#footnote85c" class="citation">[85c]</a>&nbsp; The modern 
faker sometimes drew his marks &ldquo;free-hand,&rdquo; and 
carelessly; sometimes his regularities suggest line and 
compass.</p>
<p>Now, as to the use of compasses, a small pair were found with 
Late Celtic remains, at Lough Crew, and plaques of bone decorated
by aid of such compasses, were also found, <a 
name="citation85d"></a><a href="#footnote85d" 
class="citation">[85d]</a> in a cairn of a <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>set adorned 
with the archaic markings, cup and ring, concentric circles, 
medial lines with shorter lines sloping from them on either side,
and a design representing, apparently, an early mono-cycle!</p>
<p>For all that I know, a dweller in Dunbuie might have 
compasses, like the Lough Crew cairn artist.</p>
<p>If I have established the parallelism between Arunta churinga 
nanja and the disputed Clyde &ldquo;pendants,&rdquo; which Dr. 
Munro denies, we are reduced to one of two theories.&nbsp; Either
the Picts of Clyde, or whoever they were, repeated on stones, 
usually small, some of the patterns on the neighbouring rocks; or
the modern faker, for unknown reasons, repeated these and other 
archaic patterns on smaller stones.&nbsp; His motive is 
inscrutable: the Australian parallels were unknown to European 
science,&mdash;but he may have used European analogues.&nbsp; On 
the other hand, while Dr. Munro admits that the early Clyde 
people might have repeated the rock decorations &ldquo;on small 
objects of slate and shale,&rdquo; he says that the objects 
&ldquo;would have been, even then, as much out of place as 
surviving remains of the earlier Scottish civilisation as they 
are at the present day.&rdquo; <a name="citation86"></a><a 
href="#footnote86" class="citation">[86]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>How can we assert that magic stones, or any such stone 
objects, perforated or not, were necessarily incongruous with 
&ldquo;the earlier Scottish civilisation?&rdquo;&nbsp; No 
civilisation, old or new, is incapable of possessing such stones;
even Scotland, as I shall show, can boast two or three samples, 
such as the stone of the Keiss broch, a perfect circle, engraved 
with what looks like an attempt at a Runic inscription; and 
another in a kind of cursive characters.</p>

<p>In the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries</i> 
(Scot.) (1902-1903, p. 166 <i>et seq.</i>) Mr. Graham Callander, 
already cited, devotes a very careful essay to such perforated 
stones, circular or triangular, or otherwise shaped, found in the
Garioch.&nbsp; They are of slate, or &ldquo;heather stone,&rdquo;
and of various shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Their original purpose is 
unknown.&nbsp; The perforation, or cup not perforated, is 
sometimes in the centre, in a few cases in &ldquo;near the 
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Graham Callander heard of a recent old lady
in Roxburghshire, who kept one of these stones, of irregularly 
circular shape, behind the door for luck. <a 
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"

90</span>XXIII&mdash;MODERN SURVIVAL OF MAGICAL WOOD 
CHURINGA</h2>
<p>I take another example of modern survival in magic.&nbsp; Dr. 
Munro, perhaps, would think wooden churinga, used for magical 
ends, &ldquo;incongruous with the earlier Scottish 
civilisation.&rdquo;&nbsp; But such objects have not proved to be
incongruous with the Scottish civilisation of the nineteenth 
century.</p>
<p>The term <i>churinga</i>, &ldquo;sacred,&rdquo; is used by the
Arunta to denote not only the stone churinga nanja, a local 
peculiarity of the Arunta and Kaitish, but also the decorated and
widely diffused elongated wooden slats called &ldquo;Bull 
Roarers&rdquo; by the English.&nbsp; These are swung at the end 
of a string, and produce a whirring roar, supposed to be the 
voice of a supernormal being, all over Australia and 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>I am speaking of <i>survivals</i>, and these wooden churinga, 
at least, <i>survive</i> in Scotland, and, in <!-- page 91--><a 
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Aberdeenshire
they are, or were lately called &ldquo;thunner spells&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;thunder bolts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was believed that 
the use of this instrument during a thunderstorm saved one from 
being struck by the thunner bolt.&rdquo;&nbsp; In North and South
America the bull roarer, on the other hand, is used, not to 
avert, but magically to produce thunder and lightning. <a 
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91" 
class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; Among the Kaitish thunder is 
caused by the churinga of their &ldquo;sky dweller,&rdquo; 
Atnatu.</p>
<p>Wherever the toy is used for a superstitious purpose, it is, 
so far, <i>churinga</i>, and, so far, modern Aberdeenshire had 
the same <i>churinga irula</i> as the Arunta.&nbsp; The object 
was familiar to palaeolithic man.</p>
<h2><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>XXIV&mdash;CONCLUSION OF ARGUMENT FROM SURVIVALS IN 
MAGIC</h2>
<p>I have made it perfectly certain that magic stones, 
&ldquo;witch stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;charm stones,&rdquo; and that 
<i>churinga irula</i>, wooden magical slats of wood, exist in 
Australia and other savage regions, and survive, as magical, into
modern British life.&nbsp; The point is beyond doubt, and it is 
beyond doubt that, in many regions, the stones, and the slats of 
wood, may be inscribed with archaic markings, or may be 
uninscribed.&nbsp; This will be proved more fully later.&nbsp; 
Thus Pictish, like modern British civilisation, may assuredly 
have been familiar with charm stones.&nbsp; There is no <i>a 
priori</i> objection as to the possibility.</p>
<p>Why should Pictish stones <i>not</i> be inscribed with archaic
patterns familiar to the dwellers among inscribed rocks, perhaps 
themselves the inscribers of the rocks?&nbsp; Manifestly there is
no <i>a priori</i> improbability.&nbsp; I have seen the <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>archaic patterns of concentric circles and fish spines, 
(or whatever we call the medial line with slanting side lines,) 
neatly designed in white on the flag stones in front of cottage 
doors in Galloway.&nbsp; The cottagers dwelt near the rocks with 
similar patterns on the estate of Monreith, but are not likely to
have copied them; the patterns, I presume, were mere survivals in
tradition.</p>
<p>The Picts, or whoever they were, might assuredly use charm 
stones, and the only objection to the idea that they might 
engrave archaic patterns on them is the absence of record of 
similarly inscribed small stones in Britain.&nbsp; The custom of 
using magic stones was not at all incongruous with the early 
Pictish civilisation, which retained a form of the Family now 
long outworn by the civilisation of the Arunta.&nbsp; The sole 
objection is that <i>a silentio</i>, silence of archaeological 
records as to <i>inscribed</i> small stones.&nbsp; That is not a 
closer of discussion, nor is the silence absolute, as I shall 
show.</p>
<p>Moreover, the appearance of an unique and previously 
unheard-of set of inscribed stones, in a site of the usual broch 
and crannog period, is not invariably ascribed to forgery, even 
by the most orthodox archaeologists.&nbsp; Thus Sir Francis Terry
found unheard-of things, not to mention &ldquo;a number of thin 
flat circular discs of various <!-- page 94--><a 
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>sizes&rdquo; 
in his Caithness brochs.&nbsp; In Wester broch &ldquo;the most 
remarkable things found&rdquo; were three egg-shaped quartzite 
pearls &ldquo;having their surface painted with spots in a 
blackish or blackish-brown pigment.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also found a 
flattish circular disc of sandstone, inscribed with a duck or 
other water-fowl, while on one side was an attempt, apparently, 
to write runes, on the other an inscription in unknown cursive 
characters.&nbsp; There was a boulder of sandstone with nine cup 
marks, and there were more painted pebbles, the ornaments now 
resembling ordinary cup marks, now taking the shape of a cross, 
and now of lines and other patterns, one of which, on an Arunta 
rock, is of unknown meaning, among many of known totemic 
significance.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Anderson compares these to &ldquo;similar pebbles 
painted with a red pigment&rdquo; which M. Piette found in the 
cavern of Mas d&rsquo;Azil, of which the relics are, in part at 
least, palaeolithic, or &ldquo;mesolithic,&rdquo; and of dateless
antiquity.&nbsp; In <i>L&rsquo;Anthropologie</i> (Nov. 1894), Mr.
Arthur Bernard Cook suggests that the pebbles of Mas d&rsquo;Azil
may correspond to the stone churinga nanja of the Arunta; a few 
of which appear to be painted, not incised.&nbsp; I argued, on 
the contrary, that things of similar appearance, at Mas 
d&rsquo;Azil: in Central Australia: and in <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Caithness, 
need not have had the same meaning and purpose. <a 
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a" 
class="citation">[95a]</a></p>
<p>It is only certain that the pebbles of the Caithness brochs 
are as absolutely unfamiliar as the inscribed stones of 
Dumbuck.&nbsp; But nobody says that the Caithness painted pebbles
are forgeries or modern fabrications.&nbsp; Sauce for the Clyde 
goose is not sauce for the Caithness gander. <a 
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b" 
class="citation">[95b]</a></p>
<p>The use of painted pebbles and of inscribed stones, may have 
been merely <i>local</i>.</p>
<p>In Australia the stone churinga are now, since 1904, known to 
be <i>local</i>, confined to the Arunta &ldquo;nation,&rdquo; and
the Kaitish, with very few sporadic exceptions in adjacent 
tribes. <a name="citation95c"></a><a href="#footnote95c" 
class="citation">[95c]</a></p>
<p>The purely local range of the inscribed stones in Central 
Australia, makes one more anxious for further local research in 
the Clyde district and south-west coast.</p>

96</span>XXV&mdash;MY MISADVENTURE WITH THE CHARM STONE</h2>
<p>As Dr. Munro introduces the subject, I may draw another 
example of the survival of charm stones, from an amusing 
misadventure of my own.&nbsp; I was once entrusted with a charm 
stone used in the nineteenth century for the healing of cattle in
the Highlands.&nbsp; An acquaintance of mine, a Mac--- by the 
mother&rsquo;s side, inherited this heirloom with the curious box
patched with wicker-work, which was its Ark.&nbsp; It was exactly
of the shape of a &ldquo;stone churinga of the Arunta 
tribe,&rdquo; later reproduced by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. <a 
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96" 
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; On the surfaces of the ends were 
faintly traced concentric rings, that well-known pattern.&nbsp; I
wrote in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> that, &ldquo;<i>if</i> a 
Neolithic amulet, as it appears to be, it <i>may</i> supply the 
missing link in my argument,&rdquo; as being not only <!-- page 
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>a 
magic stone (which it certainly was), but a magic stone with 
archaic markings. <a name="citation97a"></a><a 
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a>&nbsp; At the 
British Museum I presently learned the real nature of the object,
to my rueful amusement.&nbsp; It had been the stone pivot of an 
old farm-gate, and, in turning on the upper and nether stones, 
had acquired the concentric circular marks.&nbsp; Not 
understanding what the thing was, the Highland maternal ancestors
of my friend had for generations used it in the magical healing 
of cattle, a very pretty case of &ldquo;survival.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p96ab.jpg">
<img alt="Figs. 9, 10" src="images/p96as.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Writing on October 19th, I explained the facts in a letter to 
the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>.&nbsp; A pseudonymous person then 
averred, in the same journal, that I had &ldquo;recently told its
readers that I had found the missing link in the chain that was 
to bind together the magic stones of the Arunta and the discs, 
images, and &lsquo;blue points&rsquo; of the Clyde crannog 
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p96bb.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 11" src="images/p96bs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I never told any mortal that I had &ldquo;found the missing 
link!&rdquo;&nbsp; I said that &ldquo;<i>if</i>&rdquo; the stone 
be Neolithic, it &ldquo;<i>may</i>&rdquo; be the missing link in 
my argument.&nbsp; Dr. Munro prints the pseudonymous letter with 
approval, but does not correct the inaccurate statement of the 
writer. <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b" 
class="citation">[97b]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Munro, I need not say, 
argues with as much candour as <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>courtesy, and
the omission of the necessary correction is an oversight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p96cb.jpg">
<img alt="Figs. 12, 13" src="images/p96cs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>However, here was a survival of the use of charm stones, and I
think that, had the stone been uninscribed (as it was 
accidentally inscribed with concentric circles by turning in its 
stone sockets), my friend&rsquo;s Highland ancestors might have 
been less apt to think it a fairy thing, and use it in cattle 
healing.</p>
<p>I trust that I have now established my parallelisms.&nbsp; The
archaic patterns of countries now civilised and of savage 
countries are assuredly parallel.&nbsp; The use of charm stones 
in civilisation and savagery is assuredly parallel.&nbsp; The 
application to these stones of the archaic patterns, by a rude 
race in Clydesdale, familiar with the patterns on rocks in the 
district, has in it nothing <i>a priori</i> improbable.</p>
<h2><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>XXVI&mdash;EUROPEAN PARALLELS TO THE DISPUTED 
OBJECTS</h2>
<p>I am not so sure as Dr. Munro is that we have not found small 
perforated stones, sometimes inscribed with archaic patterns, 
sometimes plain, even in Scotland; I shall later mention other 
places.&nbsp; For the present I leave aside the small stone, 
inscribed with concentric horse-shoes, and found in a hill-fort 
near Tarbert (Kintyre), which a friend already spoken of saw, and
of which he drew for me a sketch from memory.&nbsp; In country 
houses any intrinsically valueless object of this kind is apt to 
fall out of sight and be lost beyond recovery.</p>
<p>Sir John Evans, however, in his work on <i>Ancient Stone 
Implements</i>, p. 463 (1897), writes: &ldquo;A pendant, 
consisting of a flat pear-shaped piece of shale, 2&frac12; inches
long, and 2 inches broad, and perforated at the narrow end, was 
found along with querns, stones with concentric <!-- page 
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>circles, and cup-shaped indentations worked in them; 
stone balls, spindle whorls, and an iron axe-head, in excavating 
an underground chamber at the Tappock, Torwood, 
Stirlingshire.&nbsp; One face of this pendant was covered with 
scratches in a vandyked pattern.&nbsp; Though of smaller size 
this seems to bear some analogy with the flat amulets of schist 
of which several have been discovered in Portugal, with one face 
ornamented in much the same manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For these examples Sir John Evans refers to the 
<i>Transactions of the Ethnological Society</i>. <a 
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a" 
class="citation">[100a]</a></p>
<p>If by &ldquo;a vandyked pattern,&rdquo; Sir John means, as I 
suppose, a pattern of triangles in horizontal lines (such as the 
Portuguese patterns on stone plaques), then the elements of this 
form of decoration appear to have been not unfamiliar to the 
designers of &ldquo;cups and rings.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the cover of 
a stone cist at Carnwath we see inscribed concentric rings, and 
two large equilateral triangles, each containing three contingent
triangles, round a square space, uninscribed. <a 
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b" 
class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; The photograph of the Tappock 
stone (figs. 9, 10), shows that the marks are not of a regular 
vandyked pattern, but are <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>rather 
scribbles, like those on a Portuguese perforated stone, given by 
Vasconcellos, and on a Canadian stone pendant, published by Mr. 
David Boyle (figs. 12, 13).</p>
<p>Sir John Evans does not reject the pear-shaped object of 
shale, &ldquo;a pendant,&rdquo; found in a Scottish site, and 
associated with querns, and an iron axe, and cup and ring 
stones.&nbsp; Sir John sees no harm in the &ldquo;pendant,&rdquo;
but Dr. Munro rejects a &ldquo;pear-shaped&rdquo; claystone 
&ldquo;pendant&rdquo; decorated with &ldquo;cup-shaped 
indentations,&rdquo; found at Dunbuie. <a 
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101" 
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; It has a perforation near each 
end, as is common in North American objects of similar nature 
(see fig. 11).</p>
<p>Why should the schist pendant of the Tappock chamber be all 
right, if the claystone pendant of Dunbuie be all wrong?&nbsp; 
One of them seems to me to have as good a claim to our respectful
consideration as the other, and, like Sir John Evans, I shall now
turn to Portugal in search of similar objects of undisputed 
authenticity.</p>

<p>M. Cartailhac, the very eminent French archaeologist, found 
not in Portugal, but in the Cevennes, &ldquo;plaques of slate, 
sometimes pierced with a hole for suspension, usually smaller 
than those of the Casa da Moura, not ornamented, <i>yet certainly
analogous with these</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation102a"></a><a

also analogous with &ldquo;engraved plaques of schist found in

Ribeiro.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Rio Negro objects appear doubtful. 
<a name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b"

<p>Portugal has many such plaques, some adorned with designs, and
some plain. <a name="citation102c"></a><a href="#footnote102c" 
class="citation">[102c]</a>&nbsp; The late Don Estacio da Veiga 
devotes a chapter to them, as <!-- page 103--><a

were things peculiar to Portugal, in Europe. <a

ornament is usually linear; in two cases <a

class="citation">[103b]</a> lines incised lead to 
&ldquo;cups.&rdquo;&nbsp; One plaque is certainly meant to 
represent the human form.&nbsp; M. Cartailhac holds that all the 
plaques with a &ldquo;vandyked&rdquo; pattern in triangles, 
without faces, &ldquo;are, none the less, <i>des 
repr&eacute;sentations stylis&eacute;es de silhouette

href="#footnote103c" class="citation">[103c]</a></p>
<p>Illustrations give an idea of them (figs. 14, 15, 16); they 
are more elaborate than the perforated inscribed plaques of shale
or schist from Dumbuck.&nbsp; Two perforated stone plaques from 
Vol&oacute;sova, figured by Dr. Munro (pp. 78, 79), fall into 
line with other inscribed plaques from Portugal.&nbsp; Of these 
Russian objects referred to by Dr. Munro, one is (his fig. 25) a 
roughly pear-shaped thing in flint, perforated at the thin end; 
the other is a formless stone plaque, inscribed with a cross, 
three circles, not concentric, and other now meaningless 
scratches.&nbsp; It is not perforated.&nbsp; Dr. Munro does not 
dispute the genuine character of many strange figurines in flint,
from Vol&oacute;sova, though the redoubtable M. de Mortillet 
denounced them as forgeries; they had the misfortune to 
corroborate <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>other Italian finds against which M.
de Mortillet had a grudge.&nbsp; But Dr. Munro thinks that the 
two plaques of Vol&oacute;sova may have been made for sale by 
knavish boys.&nbsp; In that case the boys fortuitously coincided,
in their fake, with similar plaques, of undoubted antiquity, and,
in some prehistoric Egyptian stones, occasionally inscribed with 
mere wayward scratches.</p>
<p>For these reasons I think the Vol&oacute;sova plaques as 
genuine as any other objects from that site, and corroborative, 
so far, of similar things from Clyde.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p104b.jpg">
<img alt="Figs. 14, 15" src="images/p104s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>To return to Portugal, M. Cartailhac recognises that the 
<i>plain</i> plaques of slate from sites in the Cevennes 
&ldquo;are certainly analogous&rdquo; with the plaques from the 
Casa da Moura, even when these are elaborately ornamented with 
vandyked and other patterns.&nbsp; I find one published case of a
Portuguese plaque with cups and ducts, as at Dumbuck (fig. 
16).&nbsp; Another example is in <i>Antiguedades Prehistoricas de
Andalucia</i>, p. 109. <a name="citation104"></a><a 
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; However, Dr.
Munro leaves the Cevennes Andalusian, and Portuguese plaques out 
of his argument.</p>
<p>M. Cartailhac, then, found inscribed and perforated slate 
tablets &ldquo;very common in Portugues neolithic 
sepulchres.&rdquo;&nbsp; The perforated holes <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>showed 
signs of long wear from attachment to something or 
somebody.&nbsp; One, from New Jersey, with two holes, exactly as 
in the Dunbuie example, was much akin in ornament to the 
Portuguese plaques.&nbsp; One, of slate, was plain, as plain as 
&ldquo;a bit of gas coal with a round hole bored through 
it,&rdquo; recorded by Dr. Munro from Ashgrove Loch 
crannog.&nbsp; A perforated shale, or slate, or schist or gas 
coal plaque, as at Ashgrove Loch, ornamented or plain, is 
certainly like another shale schist or slate plaque, plain or 
inscribed.&nbsp; We have shown that these occur in France, 
Portugal, Russia, America, and Scotland, not to speak of Central 
Australia.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that, if the Clyde objects are forged, the 
forger knew a good deal of archaeology&mdash;knew that perforated
inscribed plaques of soft mineral occurred in many 
countries&mdash;but he did not slavishly imitate the 
patterns.</p>
<p>By a pleasant coincidence, at the moment of writing, comes to 
me the <i>Annual Archaeological Report</i>, 1904, of the Canadian
Bureau of Education, kindly sent by Mr. David Boyle.&nbsp; He 
remarks, as to stone pendants found in Canadian soil, &ldquo;The 
forms of what we call pendants varied greatly, and were probably 
made to adapt themselves to <i>the natural shapes of water-worn 
stones</i>. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; This is exactly what Dr. Munro 
says <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>about the small stone objects from 
the three Clyde stations.&nbsp; &ldquo;The pendants, amulets, and
idols <i>appear to have been water-worn pieces of shale or 
slate</i>, before they were perforated, decorated, and 
polished&rdquo; (Munro, p. 254).&nbsp; The forger may have been 
guided by the ancient Canadian pendants; that man knows 
everything!</p>
<p>Mr. Boyle goes on, speaking of the superstitious still 
surviving instinct of treasuring such stones, &ldquo;For some 
unknown reason, many of us exhibit a desire to pick up pebbles so
marked, and examples of the kind are often carried as pocket 
pieces,&rdquo; obviously &ldquo;for luck.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gives 
one case of such a stone being worn for fifty years as a 
&ldquo;watch pendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perforated stones have always 
had a &ldquo;fetishness&rdquo; attached to them, adds Mr. 
Boyle.&nbsp; He then publishes several figures of such 
stones.&nbsp; Two of these, with archaic markings like many in 
Portugal, and one with an undisputed analogue from a Scottish 
site, are reproduced (figs. 12, 13).</p>
<p>It is vain to tell us that the uses of such fetishistic stones
are out of harmony with any civilisation.&nbsp; The civilisation 
of the dwellers in the Clyde sites was not so highly advanced as 
to reject a superstition which still survives.&nbsp; Nor is there
any reason why these people should not have scratched archaic 
markings on the pebbles <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>as they 
certainly cut them on stones in a Scottish crannog of the Iron 
age.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro agrees with me that rude scribings on shale or slate
are found, of a post-Christian date, at St. Blane&rsquo;s, in 
Bute. <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107" 
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; The art, if art it can be 
called, is totally different, of course, from the archaic types 
of decoration, but all the things have <i>this</i> in common, 
that they are rudely incised on shale or slate.</p>
<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>XXVIII&mdash;QUESTION AS TO THE 
OBJECTS AS ORNAMENTS OF THE PERSON</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro now objects that among the objects reckoned by me as
analogous to churinga is a perforated stone with an incised line,
and smaller slanting side lines, said to have been found at 
Dumbuck; &ldquo;9 inches long, 3&frac12; inches broad, and 
&frac12; an inch thick.&rdquo; <a name="citation108"></a><a 
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; I wish that 
he gave us the weight.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;that no human being 
would wear this as an ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No human being wears any churinga &ldquo;as an 
ornament!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody says that they do.</p>
<p>Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, moreover, speak of &ldquo;a long 
stone churinga,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;especially large ones&rdquo;
made by the mythical first ancestors of the race.&nbsp; Churinga,
over a foot in length, they tell us, are not usually perforated; 
many churinga are not perforated, many are: <i>but the Arunta do 
not </i><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span><i>know why some are 
perforated</i>.&nbsp; There is a legend that, of old, men hung up
the perforated churinga on the sacred <i>Nurtunja</i> pole: and 
so they still have <i>perforated</i> stone churinga, not usually 
more than a foot in length. <a name="citation109"></a><a 
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a></p>
<p>If Dr. Munro has studied Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, he cannot
but know that churinga are not ornaments, are not all oval, but 
of many shapes and sizes, and that churinga larger than the 9 
inch perforated stone from Dumbuck are perforated, and attached 
to strings.&nbsp; I cannot tell the reason why, any better than 
the Arunta can; and, of course, I cannot know why the 9 inch 
stone from Dumbuck (if genuine) was perforated.&nbsp; But what I 
must admire is the amazing luck or learning of Dr. Munro&rsquo;s 
supposed impostor.&nbsp; Not being &ldquo;a semi-detached 
idiot&rdquo; he must have known that no mortal would sling about 
his person, as an ornament, a chunk of stone 9 inches long, 
3&frac12; broad, and &frac12; an inch thick.&nbsp; Dr. Munro 
himself insists on the absurdity of supposing that &ldquo;any 
human being&rdquo; would do such a thing.&nbsp; Yet the forger 
drilled a neat hole, as if for a string for suspension, at the 
apex of the chunk.&nbsp; If he knew, before any other human being
in England, that the Arunta do this very thing to <!-- page 
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>some stone churinga, though seldom to churinga over a 
foot in length,&mdash;and if he imitated the Arunta custom, the 
impostor was a very learned impostor.&nbsp; If he did <i>not</i> 
know, he was a very lucky rogue, for the Arunta coincide in doing
the same thing to great stone churinga: without being aware of 
any motive for the performance as they never suspend churinga to 
anything, though they say that their mythical ancestors did.</p>
<p>The impostor was also well aware of the many perforated stones
that exist in Scotland, not referred to by Dr. Munro.&nbsp; He 
perforated some which could not be worn as ornaments, just as the
Arunta do.&nbsp; We shall find that the forger, either by dint of
wide erudition, or by a startling set of chance coincidences, 
keeps on producing objects which are analogous to genuine relics 
found in many sites of early life.</p>
<p>This is what makes the forger so interesting.</p>
<p>My theory of the forger is at the opposite pole from the 
theory of Dr. Munro.&nbsp; He says that, &ldquo;in applying these
local designs&rdquo; (the worldwide archaic patterns,) to 
unworked splinters of sandstone and pieces of water-worn shale 
and slate, &ldquo;the manufacturers had evidently not sufficient 
archaeological knowledge to realise the significance of the fact 
that they were doing what prehistoric <!-- page 111--><a 
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>man, in 
this country, is never known to have done before.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111" 
class="citation">[111]</a></p>
<p>But, (dismissing the Kintyre and Tappock stones,) the 
&ldquo;manufacturers&rdquo; did know, apparently, that perforated
and inscribed, or uninscribed tablets and plaques of shale and 
schist and slate and gas coal were found in America, France, 
Russia, and Portugal, and imitated these things or coincided in 
the process by sheer luck.&nbsp; The &ldquo;manufacturers&rdquo; 
were, perhaps, better informed than many of their critics.&nbsp; 
But, if the things are genuine, more may be found by research in 
the locality.</p>
<h2><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>XXIX&mdash;WEAPONS</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro is less than kind to the forger in the matter of the
&ldquo;weapons&rdquo; found at Dunbuie and Dumbuck.&nbsp; They 
are &ldquo;absolutely worthless as real weapons,&rdquo; he says, 
with perfect truth, for they are made of slate or shale, 
<i>not</i> of hard stony slate, which many races used to employ 
for lack of better material. <a name="citation112a"></a><a 
href="#footnote112a" class="citation">[112a]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p113a.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 16" src="images/p113a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The forger was obviously not thinking of dumping down 
<i>serviceable</i> sham weapons.&nbsp; He could easily have 
bought as many genuine flint celts and arrow-heads and knives as 
he needed, had his aim been to prove his sites to be 
neolithic.&nbsp; So I argued long ago, in a newspaper 
letter.&nbsp; Dr. Munro replies among other things, that 
&ldquo;nothing could be easier than to detect modern imitations 
of Neolithic relics.&rdquo; <a name="citation112b"></a><a 
href="#footnote112b" class="citation">[112b]</a>&nbsp; I said not
a word about <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>&ldquo;modern 
imitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said that a forger, anxious to fake a 
Neolithic site, &ldquo;would, of course, drop in a few Neolithic 
arrow-heads, &lsquo;celts&rsquo; and so forth,&rdquo; meaning 
genuine objects, very easily to be procured for money.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p113bb.jpg">
<img alt="Figs. 17, 18" src="images/p113bs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As the forger did not adopt a device so easy, so obvious, and 
so difficult of detection, (if he purchased Scottish flint 
implements) his aim was not to fake a Neolithic site.&nbsp; He 
put in, not well-known genuine Neolithic things, but things of a 
character with which some of his critics were not familiar, yet 
which have analogues elsewhere.</p>
<p>Why did he do that?</p>
<p>As to the blunt decorated slate weapons, the forger did not 
mean, I think, to pass off these as practicable arms of the 
Neolithic period.&nbsp; These he could easily have bought from 
the dealers.&nbsp; What he intended to dump down were not 
practical weapons, but, in one case at least, <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>, as French archaeologists call them, weapons 
of show or ceremony.</p>
<p>The strange &ldquo;vandyked&rdquo; crozier-like stone objects 
of schist or shale from Portugal were possibly <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>, or heads of staves of dignity.&nbsp; There 
is a sample in the American room at the British Museum, 
uninscribed.&nbsp; I submit that the three very curious and 
artistic stone axe-heads, <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>figured by 
M. Cartailhac, <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114" 
class="citation">[114]</a> representing, one an uncouth animal; 
another, a hooded human head, the third an extremely pretty girl,
could never have been used for practical purposes, but were 
<i>armes d&rsquo;apparat</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps such stone <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>, or magical or sacred arms, were not unknown,
as survivals, in Scotland in the Iron Age.&nbsp; A 
&ldquo;celt&rdquo; or stone axe-head of this kind, ornamented 
with a pattern of inter-crossing lines, is figured and described 
by the Rev. Mr. Mackenzie (Kenmore) in the <i>Proceedings</i> of 
the Scottish Society of Antiquaries (1900-1901, p. 310 <i>et 
seq.</i>).&nbsp; This axe-head, found near a cairn at 
Balnahannait, is of five inches long by two and a quarter 
broad.&nbsp; It is of &ldquo;soft micaceous stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The owners must have been acquainted with the use of the metals, 
Mr. Mackenzie thinks, for the stone exhibits &ldquo;interlaced 
work of a late variety of this ornamentation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Mackenzie suggests that the ornament was perhaps added 
&ldquo;after the axe had obtained some kind of venerated or 
symbolical character.&rdquo;&nbsp; This implies that a 
metal-working people, finding a stone axe, were puzzled by it, 
venerated it, and decorated it in their late style of 
ornament.</p>
<p>In that case, who, in earlier times, made an <!-- page 
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
115</span>useless axe-head of soft micaceous stone, and 
why?&nbsp; It could be of no practical service.&nbsp; On the 
other hand, people who had the metals might fashion a soft stone 
into an <i>arme d&rsquo;apparat</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;It cannot have 
been intended for ordinary use,&rdquo; &ldquo;the axe may have 
been a sacred or ceremonial one,&rdquo; says Mr. Mackenzie, and 
he makes the same conjecture as to another Scottish stone 
axe-head. <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115" 
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<p>Here, then, if Mr. Mackenzie be right, we have a soft stone 
axe-head, decorated with &ldquo;later ornament,&rdquo; the 
property of a people who knew the metals, and regarded the object
as &ldquo;a sacred or ceremonial one,&rdquo; <i>enfin</i>, as an 
<i>arme d&rsquo;apparat</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro doubtless knows all that is known about <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>, but he unkindly forgets to credit the forger
with the same amount of easily accessible information, when the 
forger dumps down a decorated slate spear-head, eleven inches 
long.</p>
<p>Believe me, this forger was no fool: he knew what he was 
about, and he must have laughed when critics said that his slate 
spear-heads would be useless.&nbsp; He expected the learned to 
guess what he was forging; not practicable weapons, but <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>; survivals of a ceremonial kind, like Mr. 
Mackenzie&rsquo;s decorated axe-head of soft stone.</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span><i>That</i>, I think, was our forger&rsquo;s little 
game; for even if he thought no more than Dr. Munro seems to do 
of the theory of &ldquo;survivals,&rdquo; he knew that the theory
is fashionable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing like these spear-heads . . .
has hitherto been found in Scotland, so that they cannot be 
survivals from a previous state of things in our country,&rdquo; 
says Dr. Munro. <a name="citation116a"></a><a 
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a>&nbsp; The 
argument implies that there is nothing in the soil of our country
of a nature still undiscovered.&nbsp; This is a large assumption,
especially if Mr. Mackenzie be right about the sacred ceremonial 
decorated axe-head of soft stone.&nbsp; The forger, however, knew
that elsewhere, if not in Scotland, there exist useless <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>, and he obviously meant to fake a few 
samples.&nbsp; He was misunderstood.&nbsp; I knew what he was 
doing, for it seems that &ldquo;Mr. Lang . . . suggested that the
spear-heads were not meant to be used as weapons, but as 
&lsquo;sacred things.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a>&nbsp; I knew 
little; but I did know the sacred boomerang-shaped decorated 
Arunta churinga, and later looked up other <i>armes 
d&rsquo;apparat</i>. <a name="citation116c"></a><a 
href="#footnote116c" class="citation">[116c]</a></p>
<p>Apparently I must have &ldquo;coached&rdquo; the forger, and 
told him what kinds of things to fake.&nbsp; But I protest 
solemnly that I am innocent!&nbsp; He got up the subject for 
himself, and knew more than many <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>of his 
critics.&nbsp; I had no more to do with the forger than M. 
Salomon Reinach had to do with faking the golden &ldquo;tiara of 
Saitaphernes,&rdquo; bought by the Louvre for &pound;8000.&nbsp; 
M. Reinack denies the suave suggestion that <i>he</i> was at the 
bottom of this imposture. <a name="citation117a"></a><a 
href="#footnote117a" class="citation">[117a]</a>&nbsp; I also am 
innocent of instructing the Clyde forger.&nbsp; He read books, 
English, French, German, American, Italian, Portuguese, and 
Spanish.</p>
<p>From the <i>Bulletino di Palaetnologia Italiana</i>, vol. xi. 
p. 33, 1885, plate iv., and from Professor Pigorini&rsquo;s 
article there, he prigged the idea of a huge stone weapon, of no 
use, found in a grotto near Verona. <a name="citation117b"></a><a
href="#footnote117b" class="citation">[117b]</a>&nbsp; This 
object is of flint, shaped like a flint arrow-head; is ten inches
and a half in length, and &ldquo;weighs over 3&frac12; 
pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pigorini conjectured that it had some
religious signification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspired by this arrow-head of Gargantua, the Clyde forger 
came in with a still longer decorated slate spear-head, weighing 
I know not how much.&nbsp; It is here photographed (figs. 17, 
18).&nbsp; Compare the decoration of three parallel horizontal 
lines with that on the broken Portuguese perforated stone (figs. 
9, 10).&nbsp; Or did the Veronese forger come to Clyde, and carry
on the business at Dumbuck?&nbsp; <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The man has
read widely.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, he may have resorted to 
sources which, though excellent, are accessible and cheap, like 
Mr. Haddon&rsquo;s <i>Evolution in Art</i>.&nbsp; Here (pp. 79, 
80) the faker could learn all that he needed to know about 
<i>armes d&rsquo;apparat</i> in the form of stone axe-heads, 
&ldquo;unwieldy and probably quite useless objects&rdquo; found 
by Mr. Haddon in the chain of isles south-east of New 
Guinea.&nbsp; Mr. Romilly and Dr. Wyatt Gill attest the existence
of similar axes of ceremony.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are not intended 
for cleaving timber.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see &ldquo;the metamorphosis
of a practical object into an unpractical one.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118" 
class="citation">[118]</a></p>
<p>The forger thus had sources for his great decorated slate 
spear-head; the smaller specimens may be sketches for that 
colossal work.</p>
<h2><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>XXX&mdash;THE FIGURINES</h2>
<p>Dr. Munro writes of &ldquo;the carved figurines, 
&lsquo;idols,&rsquo; or &lsquo;totems,&rsquo; six in 
number,&rdquo; four from Dumbuck, one from Langbank. <a 
name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a" 
class="citation">[119a]</a>&nbsp; Now, first, nobody knows the 
purpose of the rude figurines found in many sites from Japan to 
Troy, from Russia to the Lake Dwellings of Europe, and in West 
Africa, where the negroes use these figurines, when found, as 
&ldquo;fetish,&rdquo; knowing nothing of their origin 
(<i>Man</i>, No. 7, July, 1905).&nbsp; Like a figurine of a 
woman, found in the Dumbuck kitchen midden, they are discovered 
in old Japanese kitchen middens. <a name="citation119b"></a><a 
href="#footnote119b" class="citation">[119b]</a></p>
<p>The astute forger, knowing that figurines were found in 
Japanese kitchen middens, knowing it before Y. Koganei published 
the fact in 1903, <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>thought the Dumbuck kitchen midden 
an appropriate place for a figurine.&nbsp; Dr. Munro, possibly 
less well-informed, regards the bottom of a kitchen midden at 
Dumbuck as &ldquo;a strange resting place for a goddess.&rdquo; 
<a name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a" 
class="citation">[120a]</a>&nbsp; Now, as to 
&ldquo;goddess&rdquo; nobody knows anything.&nbsp; Dr. Schliemann
thought that the many figurines of clay, in Troy, were meant for 
Hera and Athene.&nbsp; Nobody knows, but every one not wholly 
ignorant sees the absurdity of speaking of figurines as 
&ldquo;totems&rdquo;; of course the term is not Dr. 
Munro&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>We know not their original meaning, but they occur &ldquo;all 
over the place&rdquo;; in amber on the Baltic coast, with 
grotesque faces carved in amber.&nbsp; In Russia and Finland, and
in sites of prehistoric Egypt, on slate, and in other materials 
such grotesques are common. <a name="citation120b"></a><a 
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a>&nbsp; Egypt is a
great centre of the Early Slate School of Art, the things ranging
from slate plaques covered with disorderly scratchings 
&ldquo;without a conscience or an aim,&rdquo; to highly decorated
<i>palettes</i>.&nbsp; There is even a perforated object like the
slate crooks of M. Cartailhac, from Portugal, but rather more 
like the silhouette of a <!-- page 121--><a 
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>bird, <a 
name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"

in soft stone. <a name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b"
class="citation">[121b]</a>&nbsp; Some of the prehistoric 
figurines of human beings from Egypt are studded with 
&ldquo;cups,&rdquo; <i>cupules</i>, <i>&eacute;cuelles</i>, or 
whatever we may be permitted to name them.&nbsp; In short, early 
and rude races turn out much the same set of crude works of art 
almost everywhere, and the extraordinary thing is, not that a few
are found in a corner of Britain, but that scarce any have been 
found.</p>

<p>As to the Russo-Finnish flint figurines, Mr. Abercromby thinks
that these objects may &ldquo;have served as household gods or 
personal amulets,&rdquo; and Dr. Munro regards Mr. 
Abercromby&rsquo;s as &ldquo;the most rational explanation of 
their meaning and purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaks of figurines of
clay (the most usual material) in Carniola, Bosnia, and 
Transylvania.&nbsp; &ldquo;Idols and amulets were indeed 
universally used in prehistoric times.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation121c"></a><a href="#footnote121c" 
class="citation">[121c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Objects which come under
the same category&rdquo; occur &ldquo;in various parts of 
America.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bruce <a name="citation121d"></a><a 
href="#footnote121d" class="citation">[121d]</a> refers to M. 
Reinach&rsquo;s vast collection of designs of such figurines in 
<i>L&rsquo;Anthropologie</i>, vol. v., 1894.&nbsp; Thus rude 
figurines in sites of many stages are very familiar 
objects.&nbsp; The forger knew it, and <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>dumped down
a few at Dumbuck.&nbsp; His female figurine (photographed in fig.
19), seems to me a very &ldquo;plausible&rdquo; figurine in 
itself.&nbsp; It does not appear to me &ldquo;unlike anything in 
any collection in the British Isles, or elsewhere&rdquo;&mdash;I 
mean <i>elsewhere</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Munro admits that it discloses 
&ldquo;the hand of one not altogether ignorant of art.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122" 
class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; I add that it discloses the hand
of one not at all ignorant of genuine prehistoric figurines 
representing women.</p>
<p>But I know nothing analogous from <i>British</i> sites.&nbsp; 
Either such things do not exist (of which we cannot be certain), 
or they have escaped discovery and record.&nbsp; Elsewhere they 
are, confessedly, well known to science, and therefore to the 
learned forger who, nobody can guess why, dumped them down with 
the other fraudulent results of his researches.</p>
<p>If the figurines be genuine, I suppose that the Clyde folk 
made them for the same reasons as the other peoples who did so, 
whatever those reasons may have been: or, like the West Africans,
found them, relics of a forgotten age, and treasured them.&nbsp; 
If their reasons were religious or superstitious, how am I to 
know what were the theological tenets of the Clyde <!-- page 
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>residents?&nbsp; They may have been more or less got at
by Christianity, in Saint Ninian&rsquo;s time, but the influence 
might well be slight.&nbsp; On the other hand, neither men nor 
angels can explain why the forger faked his figurines, for which 
he certainly had a model&mdash;at least as regards the female 
figure&mdash;in a widely distributed archaic feminine type of 
&ldquo;dolly.&rdquo;&nbsp; The forger knew a good deal!</p>
<p>Dr. Munro writes: &ldquo;That the disputed objects are amusing
playthings&mdash;the sportive productions of idle wags who 
inhabited the various sites&mdash;seems to be the most recent 
opinion which finds acceptance among local antiquaries.&nbsp; But
this view involves the contemporaneity of occupancy of the 
respective sites, of which there is no evidence. . . .&rdquo; <a 
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a" 
class="citation">[123a]</a></p>
<p>There is no evidence for &ldquo;contemporaneity of 
occupancy&rdquo; if Dunbuie be of 300-900 <span 
class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and Dumbuck and Langbank of 1556-1758.
<a name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b" 
class="citation">[123b]</a>&nbsp; But we, and apparently Dr. 
Munro (p. 264) have rejected the &ldquo;Corporation cairn&rdquo; 
theory, the theory of the cairn erected in 1556, or 1612, and 
lasting till 1758.&nbsp; The genuine undisputed relics, according
to Dr. Munro, are such as &ldquo;are commonly found on crannogs, 
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>brochs, and other early inhabited sites of 
Scotland.&rdquo; <a name="citation124a"></a><a 
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a>&nbsp; The sites 
are all, and the genuine relics in the sites are all &ldquo;of 
some time between the fifth and twelfth centuries.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b" 
class="citation">[124b]</a>&nbsp; The sites are all close to each
other, the remains are all of the same period, (unless the late 
Celtic comb chance to be earlier,) yet Dr. Munro says that 
&ldquo;for contemporaneity of occupancy there is no 
evidence.&rdquo; <a name="citation124c"></a><a 
href="#footnote124c" class="citation">[124c]</a>&nbsp; He none 
the less repeats the assertion that they are of &ldquo;precisely 
the same chronological horizon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
chronological horizon&rdquo; (of Langbank and Dumbuck) 
&ldquo;<i>seems to me to be precisely the same</i>, <i>viz.</i> a
date well on in the early Iron Age, posterior to the Roman 
occupation of that part of Britain&rdquo; (p. 147).</p>
<p>Thus Dr. Munro assigns to both sites &ldquo;precisely the same
chronological horizon,&rdquo; and also says that &ldquo;there is 
no evidence&rdquo; for the &ldquo;contemporaneity of 
occupancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is not, as it may appear, an example
of lack of logical consistency.&nbsp; &ldquo;The range of the 
occupancy&rdquo; (of the sites) &ldquo;is uncertain, probably it 
was different in each case,&rdquo; writes Dr. Munro. <a 
name="citation124d"></a><a href="#footnote124d" 
class="citation">[124d]</a>&nbsp; No reason is given for this 
opinion, and as all the undisputed remains are confessedly of one
stage of culture, the &ldquo;wags&rdquo; at all three sites were 
<!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
125</span>probably in the same stage of rudimentary humour and 
skill.&nbsp; If they made the things, the things are not modern 
forgeries.&nbsp; But the absence of the disputed objects from 
other sites of the same period remains as great a difficulty as 
ever.&nbsp; Early &ldquo;wags&rdquo; may have made them&mdash;but
why are they only known in the three Clyde sites?&nbsp; Also, why
are the painted pebbles only known in a few brochs of 
Caithness?</p>
<p>Have the <i>graffiti</i> on slate at St. Blane&rsquo;s, in 
Bute, been found&mdash;I mean have <i>graffiti</i> on slate like 
those of St. Blane&rsquo;s, been found elsewhere in Scotland? <a 
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125" 
class="citation">[125]</a>&nbsp; The kinds of art, writing, and 
Celtic ornament, at St. Blane&rsquo;s, are all familiar, but not 
their presence on scraps of slate.&nbsp; Some of the 
&ldquo;art&rdquo; of the Dumbuck things is also familiar, but 
not, in Scotland, on pieces of slate and shale.&nbsp; Whether 
they were done by early wags, or by a modern and rather erudite 
forger, I know not, of course; I only think that the question is 
open; is not settled by Dr. Munro.</p>
<h2><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>XXXI&mdash;GROTESQUE HEADS.&nbsp; 
DISPUTED PORTUGUESE PARALLELS</h2>
<p>Figurines are common enough things in ancient sites; by no 
means so common are the grotesque heads found at Dumbuck and 
Langbank.&nbsp; They have recently been found in Portugal.&nbsp; 
Did the forger know that?&nbsp; Did he forge them on Portuguese 
models?&nbsp; Or was it chance coincidence?&nbsp; Or was it 
undesigned parallelism?&nbsp; There is such a case according to 
Mortillet.&nbsp; M. de Mortillet flew upon poor Prof. 
Pigorini&rsquo;s odd things, denouncing them as forgeries; he had
attacked Dr. Schliemann&rsquo;s finds in his violent way, and 
never apologised, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Then a lively squabble began.&nbsp; Italian 
&ldquo;archaeologists of the highest standing&rdquo; backed Prof.
Pigorini: Mortillet had not seen the Italian things, but he stood
to his guns.&nbsp; Things found near Cracow were taken as 
corroborating the Breonio finds, also things from 
Vol&oacute;sova, in <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Russia.&nbsp; Mortillet replied by 
asking &ldquo;why under similar conditions could not 
forgers&rdquo; (very remote in space,) &ldquo;equally fabricate 
objects of the same form.&rdquo; <a name="citation127"></a><a 
href="#footnote127" class="citation">[127]</a>&nbsp; Is it 
likely?</p>
<p>Why should they forge similar unheard-of things in Russia, 
Poland, and Italy?&nbsp; Did the same man wander about forging, 
or was telepathy at work, or do forging wits jump?&nbsp; The 
Breonio controversy is undecided; &ldquo;practised persons&rdquo;
can <i>not</i> &ldquo;read the antiquities as easily as 
print,&rdquo; to quote Mr. Read.&nbsp; They often read them in 
different ways, here as fakes, there as authentic.</p>
<p>M. Boulle, reviewing Dr. Munro in <i>L&rsquo;Anthropologie</i>
(August, 1905), says that M. Cartailhac recognises the 
genuineness of some of the strange objects from Breonio.</p>
<p>But, as to our Dumbuck things, the Clyde forger went to 
Portugal and forged there; or the Clyde forger came from 
Portugal; or forging wits coincided fairly well, in Portugal and 
in Scotland, as earlier, at Vol&oacute;sova and Breonio.</p>
<p>In <i>Portugalia</i>, a Portuguese archaeological magazine, 
edited by Don Ricardo Severe, appeared an article by the Rev. 
Father Jos&eacute; Brenha on the dolmens of Pouco 
d&rsquo;Aguiar.&nbsp; Father Raphael Rodrigues, of that place, 
asked <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Father Brenha to excavate with him 
in the Christmas holidays of 1894.&nbsp; They published some of 
their discoveries in magazines, and some of the finds were 
welcomed by Dr. Leite de Vasconcellos, in his <i>Religi&otilde;es
da Lusitania</i> (vol. i. p. 341).&nbsp; They dug in the remote 
and not very cultured Transmontane province, and, in one dolmen 
found objects &ldquo;the most extraordinary possible,&rdquo; says
Father Brenha. <a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128" 
class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; There were perforated plaques 
with alphabetic inscriptions; stones engraved with beasts of 
certain or of dubious species, very fearfully and wonderfully 
drawn; there were stone figurines of females, as at Dumbuck; 
there were stones with cups and lines connecting the cups, 
(common in many places) and, as at Dumbuck, there were grotesque 
heads in stone.&nbsp; (See a few examples, figs. 20-24).</p>
<p>Figures 20, 21, 24 are cupped, or cup and duct stones; 22 is a
female figurine; 23 is a heart-shaped charm stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p128b.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 22" src="images/p128s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On all this weighty mass of stone objects, Dr. Munro writes 
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since the MS. of this volume was placed in 
the hands of the publishers a new side-issue regarding some 
strange objects, said to have been found in Portuguese dolmens, 
has been imported into the Clyde controversy, in which Mr. Astley
<!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>has taken a prominent part.&nbsp; In a communication to
the <i>Antiquary</i>, April, 1904, he writes: &lsquo;I will 
merely say here, on this point, that my arguments are brought to 
a scientific conclusion in my paper, &lsquo;Portuguese Parallels 
to Clydeside Discoveries,&rsquo; reported in your issue for 
March, which will shortly be published.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the article in <i>Portugalia</i> and the 
published &lsquo;scientific conclusion&rsquo; of Mr. Astley 
(<i>Journal of B.A.A.</i>, April and August, 1904), and can only 
say that, even had I space to discuss the matter I would not do 
so for two reasons.&nbsp; First, because I see no parallelism 
whatever between the contrasted objects from the Portuguese 
dolmens and the Clyde ancient sites, beyond the fact that they 
are both &lsquo;queer things.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, secondly, because
some of the most eminent European scholars regard the objects 
described and illustrated in <i>Portugalia</i> as 
forgeries.&nbsp; The learned Director of the Mus&eacute;e de St. 
Germain, M. Saloman Reinach, thus writes about them: 
&lsquo;Jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; nouvel ordre, 
c&rsquo;est-&agrave;-dire jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; preuve formelle du
contraire je consid&egrave;re ces pierres sculpt&eacute;es et 
grav&eacute;es comme le produit d&rsquo;une mystification.&nbsp; 
J&rsquo;aimerais connaitre, &agrave; ce sujet, l&rsquo;opinion 
des autres savants du Portugal&rsquo; (<i>Revue 
Arch&eacute;ologique</i>, 4th S., vol. ii., 1903, p. 
431).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had brought the Portuguese things to the notice of English 
readers long before Mr. Astley did so, but that is not to the 
purpose.</p>
<p>The point is that Dr. Munro denies the parallelism between the
Clyde and Portuguese objects.&nbsp; Yet I must hold that stone 
figurines of women, grotesque heads in stone, cupped stones, 
stones with cup and duct, stones with rays proceeding from a 
central point, and perforated stones with <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>linear 
ornamentation, are rather &ldquo;parallel,&rdquo; in Portugal and
in Clydesdale.</p>
<p>So far the Scottish and the Portuguese fakers have hit on 
parallel lines of fraud.&nbsp; Meanwhile I know of no 
archaeologists except Portuguese archaeologists, who have seen 
the objects from the dolmen, and of no Portuguese archaeologist 
who disputes their authenticity.&nbsp; So there the matter rests.
<a name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130" 
class="citation">[130]</a>&nbsp; The parallelism appears to me to
be noticeable.&nbsp; I do not say that the styles of art are 
akin, but that the artists, by a common impulse, have produced 
cupped stones, perforated and inscribed stones, figurines in 
stone, and grotesque heads in stone.</p>
<p>Is not this common impulse rather curious?&nbsp; And is 
suspicion of forgery to fall, in Portugal, on respectable 
priests, or on the very uncultured wags of Traz os Montes?&nbsp; 
Mortillet, educated by priests, hated and suspected all of 
them.&nbsp; M. Cartailhac suspected &ldquo;clericals,&rdquo; as 
to the Spanish cave paintings, but acknowledged his error.&nbsp; 
I can guess no motive for the ponderous bulk of Portuguese 
forgeries, and am a little suspicious of the tendency to shout 
&ldquo;Forgery&rdquo; in the face of everything unfamiliar.</p>
<p>But the Portuguese things are suspected by <!-- page 131--><a 
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>M. 
Cartailhac, (who, however, again admits that he has been 
credulously incredulous before,) as well as by M. Reinach.&nbsp; 
The things ought to be inspected in themselves.&nbsp; I still 
think that they are on parallel lines with the work of the Clyde 
forger, who may have read about them in <i>A Vida Moderna</i> 
1895, 1896, in <i>Archeologo Portugues</i>, in <i>Encyclopedia 
dar Familiar</i>, in various numbers, and in <i>Religi&otilde;es 
da Lusitania</i>, vol. i. pp. 341, 342, (1897), a work by the 
learned Director of the Ethnological Museum of Portugal.&nbsp; To
these sources the Dumbuck forger may have gone for 
inspiration.</p>
<p>Stated without this elegant irony, my opinion is that the 
parallelism of the figurines and grotesque stone faces of Villa 
d&rsquo;Aguiar and of Clyde rather tends to suggest the 
genuineness of both sets of objects.&nbsp; But this opinion, like
my opinion about the Australian and other parallelisms, is no 
argument against Dr. Munro, for he acknowledges none of these 
parallelisms.&nbsp; That point,&mdash;a crucial point,&mdash;are 
the various sets of things analogous in character or not? must be
decided for each reader by himself, according to his knowledge, 
taste, fancy, and bias.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The most meaningless group&mdash;if a 
degree of comparison be admissible in regard to a part when the 
whole is absolutely incomprehensible on archaeological 
principles&mdash;consists of a series of unprepared and 
irregularly shaped pieces of laminated sandstone (plate xvi.) 
similar to some of the stones of which the fort of Dunbuie was 
built, <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132" 
class="citation">[132]</a> having one of their surfaces decorated
with small cup-marks, sometimes symmetrically arranged so far as 
to indicate parts of geometrical figures, and at other times 
variously combined with lines and circles.&nbsp; Two fragments of
bones, also from Dunbuie, are similarly adorned (plate xvi. nos. 
13, 14).&nbsp; Eleven of the twelve sandstone <!-- page 133--><a 
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>fragments 
which make up the group were fractured in such a manner as to 
suggest that the line of fracture had intersected the original 
ornamentation, and had thus detached a portion of it.&nbsp; If 
this be so, there must have been originally at least two or three
other portions which, if found, would fit along the margin of 
each of the extant portions, just as the fragments of a broken 
urn come together.&nbsp; Yet among these decorated stones not one
single bit fits another, nor is any of the designs the 
counterpart of another.&nbsp; If we suppose that these decorated 
stones are portions of larger tablets on which the designs were 
completed, then either they were broken before being introduced 
into the debris of the fort, or the designs were intentionally 
executed in an incomplete state, just as they are now to be seen 
on the existing natural splinters of stone.&nbsp; The supposition
that the occupiers of the fort possessed the original tablets, 
and that they had been smashed on the premises, is excluded by 
the significant fact that only one fragment of each tablet has 
been discovered.&nbsp; For, in the breaking up of such tablets, 
it would be inconceivable, according to the law of chances, that 
one portion, and only one, of each different specimen would 
remain while all the others had disappeared.&nbsp; On the other 
hand, the hypothesis that the occupiers of the fort carved these 
designs on the rough and unprepared splinters of stone in the 
precise manner they now come before us, seems to me to involve 
premeditated deception, for it is difficult to believe that such 
uncompleted designs could have any other finality of purpose.</p>
<p>Looking at these geometrical figures from the point of 
technique, they do not make a favourable impression in support of
their genuineness.&nbsp; The so-called cup-marks consist of 
punctures of two or three different sizes, so many corresponding 
to one size and so many to another.&nbsp; The stiffness of the 
lines and circles reminds one more of ruler and compass than of 
the freehand work of prehistoric artists.&nbsp; <!-- page 
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
134</span>The patterns are unprecedented for their strange 
combinations of art elements.&nbsp; For example, no. 9, plate 
xvi., looks as if it were a design for some modern 
machinery.&nbsp; The main ornament on another fragment of 
sandstone (no. 12), consisting of a cross and circle composed of 
a series of cup-marls, seems to be a completed design; but yet at
the corner there are lines which are absolutely meaningless, 
unless we suppose that they formed part of a more enlarged 
tablet.&nbsp; Similar remarks apply to nos. 3 and 8.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it really contrary to &ldquo;the law of chances&rdquo; 
that, in some 1200 years of unknown fortunes, no two fragments of
the same plates of red sandstone (some dozen in number) should be
found at Dunbuie?&nbsp; Think of all that may have occurred 
towards the scattering of fragments of unregarded sandstone 
before the rise of soil hid them all from sight.&nbsp; Where is 
the smaller portion of the shattered cup and ring marked 
sandstone block found in the Lochlee crannog?&nbsp; On the other 
hand, in the same crannog, a hammerstone broken in two was found,
each half in a different place, as were two parts of a figurine 
at Dumbuck.&nbsp; Where are the arms of the Venus of Milo, vainly
sought beside and around the rest of the statue?&nbsp; Where are 
the lost noses, arms, and legs of thousands of statues?&nbsp; 
Nobody can guess where they are or how they vanished.&nbsp; Or 
where are the lost fragments of countless objects in pottery 
found in old sites?</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>It was as easy for the forger to work over a whole 
plaque of sandstone, break it, and bury the pieces, as for him to
do what he has done.</p>
<p>These designs make an unfavourable impression because some, 
not all of them, are stiff and regular.&nbsp; The others make an 
unfavourable impression because they are so laxly executed.&nbsp;
For what conceivable purpose did the forger here resort to the 
aid of compasses, and elsewhere do nothing of the kind?&nbsp; Why
should the artist, if an old resident of Dunbuie fort, not have 
compasses, like the Cairn-wight of Lough Crew?</p>
<p>On inspecting the pieces, in the Museum, the regularity of 
design seems to me to be much exaggerated in Dr. Munro&rsquo;s 
figures, by whom drawn we are not informed.</p>
<p>As to Dr. Munro&rsquo;s figure 12, it seems to me to aim at a 
Celtic cross and circle, while part of his figure 3 suggests a 
crozier, and there is a cross on figure 18, as on a painted 
pebble from a broch in Caithness.&nbsp; The rest I cannot profess
to explain; they look like idle work on sandstone, but may have 
had a meaning to their fashioner.&nbsp; His meaning, and that of 
the forger who here changes his style, are equally 
inscrutable.</p>
<p>I return to a strange perforated pebble, an intaglio from 
Dumbuck.</p>

<p>Dr. Munro quotes, as to this pebble, the <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
136</span><i>Journal</i> of the British Archaeological 
Association: &ldquo;In the September number of the <i>Journal</i>
(p. 282) we are informed that a slaty spear-head, an arrow-head 
of bone, and a sinker stone were found in the d&eacute;bris 
inside the canoe.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the cavity of a large 
bone,&rsquo; says the writer, &lsquo;was also got an ornament of 
a peculiar stone.&nbsp; The digger unearthed it from the deposit 
at the bottom of the canoe, about 14 feet from the bow and near 
to a circular hole cut in the bottom about 3&frac12; inches in 
diameter.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a funny place to hide a precious 
ornament, for I take this peculiar stone to be that with the 
human hand incised on one side and three men rowing in a boat on 
the other! (see plate xv. no. 10).&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p136b.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 24" src="images/p136b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Here the place of discovery in the canoe is given with 
precision, and its place within the cavity of the bone is 
pronounced by Dr. Munro to be &ldquo;funny.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to 
the three men in a boat, the Rev. Geo. Wilson of Glenluce, on 
Feb. 14, 1887, presented to the Scots Antiquaries a bugle-shaped 
pendant of black shale or cannel-coal 2&frac14; inches long, with
a central groove for suspension.&nbsp; On one side of the pendant
was incised a sketch of two figures standing up in a boat or 
canoe with a high prow.&nbsp; The pendant is undisputed, the 
pebble is disputed, and we know nothing more about the matter 
(see fig. 25).</p>

<h2><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>XXXIII&mdash;DISPUTABLE AND 
CERTAINLY FORGED OBJECTS</h2>
<p>In his judicious remarks to the Society of Antiquaries, 
(<i>Proceedings</i>, xxxiv.,) Dr. Joseph Anderson observed that 
opinions would probably vary as to certain among the disputed 
objects.&nbsp; Among these are the inscribed oyster shells.&nbsp;
I see nothing <i>a priori</i> improbable in the circumstance that
men who incised certain patterns on schist or shale, should do so
on oyster shells.&nbsp; Palaeolithic man did his usual sporting 
sketches on shells, and there was a vast and varied art of 
designing on shells among the pre-Columbian natives of North 
America. <a name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137" 
class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; We here see the most primitive 
scratches developing into full-blown Aztec art.</p>
<p>If the markings were only on such inscribed shells as 
mouldered away&mdash;so Mr. Bruce tells us&mdash;when exposed to 
light and air, (I do not <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>know 
whether the designs were copied before the shells crumbled,) 
these conchological drawings would not trouble us.&nbsp; No 
modern could make the designs on shells that were hurrying into 
dust.&nbsp; We have Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s word for these mouldering 
shells, and we have the absolute certainty that such decomposing 
shells could not be incised by a hand of to-day, as shale, slate,
schist, and sandstone can now be engraved upon, fraudulently.</p>
<p>But when, as Professor Boyd Dawkins writes, the finds include 
&ldquo;two fresh shells . . . unmistakable Blue Points,&rdquo; 
drilled with perforations, or inscribed, from Dunbuie, then there
are only two possible alternatives.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They were made by the faker, or</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; into the Dunbuie
site by somebody.</p>
<p>The forger himself is, I think, far too knowing a man to fake 
inscriptions on fresh shells, even if, not being a conchologist, 
he did not know that the oysters were American blue points.</p>
<p>I have written in vain if the reader, while believing in the 
hypothesis of a forger, thinks him such an egregious ass.&nbsp; 
For Blue Points as non-existent save in America, 1 rely on Prof. 
Boyd Dawkins.</p>
<p>As the public were allowed to break off and steal the prow of 
the Dumbuck canoe, it <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>is plain that no guard was placed on
the sites.&nbsp; They lay open for months to the interpolations 
of wags, and I think, for my own part, that one of them is likely
to have introduced the famous blue points.</p>
<p>Dr. Munro tells us how a &ldquo;large-worked stone,&rdquo; a 
grotesque head, was foisted through a horizontal hole, into the 
relic bed of his kitchen midden at Elie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It lay 
under four inches of undisturbed black earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it
had been &ldquo;interpolated&rdquo; there by some &ldquo;lousy 
tykes of Fife,&rdquo; as the anti-covenanting song calls them. <a
name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139" 
class="citation">[139]</a></p>
<p>It was rather easier to interpolate Blue Point oyster shells 
at Dunbuie.&nbsp; On the other hand, two splinters of stone, 
inserted into a bone and a tyne of deer&rsquo;s horn, figured by 
Dr. Munro among Dumbuck and Dunbuie finds, seem to me rather too 
stupid fakes for the regular forger, and a trifle too clever for 
the Sunday holiday-maker.&nbsp; These two things I do not 
apologise for, or defend; my knowledge of primitive implements is
that of a literary man, but for what it is worth, it does not 
incline me to regard these things as primitive implements.</p>
<h2><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>XXXIV&mdash;CONCLUSION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>Explicit</i></span>!&nbsp; I have tried
to show cause why we should not bluntly dismiss the mass of 
disputed objects as forgeries, but should rest in a balance of 
judgment, file the objects for reference, and await the results 
of future excavations.&nbsp; If there be a faker, I hope he 
appreciates my sympathetic estimate of his knowledge, assiduity, 
and skill in <i>leger de main</i>.</p>
<p>I am the forger&rsquo;s only friend, and I ask him to come 
forward and make a clean breast of it, like the young men who 
hoaxed the Society for Psychical Research with a faked wraith, or
phantasm of the living.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let it fully now suffice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gambol has been shown!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me nearly equally improbable that a forger has 
been at work on a large scale, and that sets of objects, 
unexampled in our <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>isle, have really turned up in some 
numbers.&nbsp; But then the Caithness painted pebbles were 
equally without precedent, yet are undisputed.&nbsp; The 
proverbial fence seems, in these circumstances, to be the 
appropriate perch for Science, in fact a statue of the Muse of 
Science might represent her as sitting, in contemplation, on the 
fence.&nbsp; The strong, the very strong point against 
authenticity is this: <i>numbers</i> of the disputed objects were
found in sites of the early <i>Iron Age</i>.&nbsp; Now such 
objects, save for a few samples, are only known,&mdash;and that 
in non-British lands,&mdash;in <i>Neolithic</i> sites.&nbsp; The 
theory of survival may be thought not to cover the <i>number</i> 
of the disputed objects.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
